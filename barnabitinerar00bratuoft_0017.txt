had, according to Wood, “avoided as much as he
could the rough paths of logic and philosophy, and
traced those smooth ones of poetry and Roman
history, in which at length he did excel‚’' found the
flowers of poesy and history could not be easily
transplanted and thrive amidst the thorny places and
plashes of the Law. Most unwillingly he took leave
of the University,⁹⁵ and was compelled to address his
studies to knowledge as different from his former
element as if moulded to some new dialect3 for
though versed in most tongues, he was in this, he
declares, a mere novitiate. Here he remained long,

When Ι remain'd i' th’ Vniversitie 3

But for th' pitch of knowledg, which Ι sought z
Having both cheerfull sleep, and healthfull ayre,
And stomach too, hows’ere my commons were.
What choice delights were then afforded us
In reading Plutarch, Livie, Tacitus,
Or the Stagyrians rare philosophie,
VVhereto the Inds may not compared be
With all their precious oare ; for 1 did finde
No mine on earth could so enrich the minde.''
