Ι Ἰ· Brathwait occasionally introduced in his stories and poems

Ι incidents that happened in his own family and life3 and many

allusions therein imply that the parents, or one of them, for

Ι some cause unexplained, objected to or occasioned a deferring

of his union with Frances Lawson. In the following letter,

Ι written to obtain the licence, there seems a laboured ambiguity

! in endeavouring to assume the especial character of a friend, at
the same time using the signature of the father, or that of a near
relative or kinsman of the lady, as intending to impose on the
notary. However, if fictitious in substance, and an ingenious
love-fraud by Brathwait to effect a clandestine marriage, the
purpose succeeded3 for it was considered authentic by Mr

Hegge the Notary Public, Dur-ham, to whom it was addressed,

and the required licence immediately granted.

“ Mr. Hegge. After my right hartie commendac’ons remem-
bred gr. [greeting] I earnestlie require by a speciall frinde of
myne the rather by reason of my acquaintance wth you, to be a

agreed upon by consent of bothe ther parents: The fees therfor
dewe you shall receyue by this bearer : if the same licence must
