j “became (says Wood) Captain of a Foot-company
in the Trained-Bands,⁹⁵ a Deputy-Lieutenant in the
county of Westmorland‚ a Justice of Peace‚† and a
noted Wit and Poet. He wrote and published several
books in English, consisting of prose and poetry‚

Ἰ· This appointment he obtained very soon after his settling
in the country. “ It pleased the prince,''⁴he says, ‘⁶ to put mee
