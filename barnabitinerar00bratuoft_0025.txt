Brathwait is little obliged to honest Anthony a Ι
Wood for this character. Indeed, though the bio-
grapher is apt to deal largely in this sort of criticism
on popular writers, it is not such as conveys very pre-
cise ideas. He has said something of the same kind
of Robert Greene and many others. What is its fair
import? That our author was a favourite in his day
with a higher class of readers than in the succeeding
age l And what is this but to have incurred the evils
inseparable from the popularity of fashion ? It is of
the essence of fashion to descend in the subjects of its
dominion3 and to transfer its yoke to the vulgar, at
the period when it is thrown off by those of rank and
consideration.

To take advantage of temporary topics and a tem-
porary phraseology‚ to excite notice, is certainly a strong
presumption of a minor genius. It is that “ deciduous
sort of laurel '’ ascribed by Wood to Brathwait 3 but
it is the business of an impartial critic to examine
whether in this instance (as in many others) it has been
justly ascribed by this indiscriminate biographer. As
the author of Barnabee's sournal, it will scarcely be
denied that he possessed a native and unsophisticated
wit and humour, a perspicuity of expression, a dance of
imagery, and a facility of metre, which rank him with
those whose talents are calculated to rise above the
casual attractions derived from the manners of asingle

generation, and to command the notice and praise of
every age.÷÷
