Brathwait’s wife died March 7th, 1633, and he
piously and sincerely mourned the event. In venera-
tion of her memory, and as a public acknowledgment

ever, it is not of less interest or importance than the epistolary
scraps now too commonly made public as written by men of
talent and genius that have passed the bourn of mortality. The
envelope is lost ε it is supposed to be addressed to Sir T imothy
Hutton‚ son of the archbishop‚ who was always in difficulties:
he married a daughter of Sir George Bowes 3—and the Sir Tal-
bot named is probably Sir Talbot B„ brother to his wife3 and
the brother, Thomas B. of Streatham, Esq.

“ Sf. Such small successe did or last meeting produce, as I am
wholly disheartned to renew them. Besides, 1 doe much feare,
that in accepting of new propositionS, or admitting of any new
bargaine, it might fare wth me, as it doth wth unexperienced
younglins, who after one arrow lost, or graz'd, shoot another

⁴ after. Truth is, if these propositions (wCh in generall tearmes

you expresse in your letter) did probably induce me that they
intended any conclusion, I should be the more inclinable unto

so probably grounded as they promisse no lesse.—-If you will be

ι pleased to draw to some head such propositions as you intend,

and returne them so punctually and definitely as eyther to con-
clude so or not, I shall out of that respect and observance weh 1
tender you, not only returne answer to your demandes, but if it
shall be requisite, or that such propositions as you shall make

ἒ accommodate themselves to any probable end, I shall insert

some different place to treate more fully, touching the premizeS.
which course, as Ι conceive is so much the rather to be em-
braced, in that it prepares the parties what they may obiect, how
to resolve, and in each particular to addresse what they propose
to some effectuall conclusion. If some occasions of maine con-
sequence doe not divert my resolves, I purpose (God willing) to
be at York Assizes, against weh tyme Ι suppose upon conference
w²h S* Talbot and his brother, you may pitch upon some conclu-
sive resolves : howsoever upon returne of your particular propo-
