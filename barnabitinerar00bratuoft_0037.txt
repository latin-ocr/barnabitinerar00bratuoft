l Jan 1663— 64, thee> surviving 'Irustees were only Richard Brath-
ξ uait and Edw ard Cr0f1s‚ u ho by ΡΜ er of Attorney appointed

Roger (ζωῆς of Gray s Inn, Gendeman, to treat, determine, and
agree with Mrs Margaret Syddall, all differences and disputes

ᾗ betwixt them, which appear to have arisen on claims made sor

her son William. This difference was early compromised, but
that did not long ensure a quiet execution of the Trusts to the
Trustees. It is in such cases of common interest advisable, to
prevent endless litigation, that the original powers and regula-
tions ofevery charity should be defined, and kept, together with
an account of the funds, successive appointments, and yearly pay-
ments, properly accessible, either as a provincial register, or else
in some public depositary for county archives. Such a measure
would preserve the sunds of the charities from the peculation of
individuals appointed as officers therein, and undue partiality of
acting Trustees. Another evil might also be prevented, now
rapidly increasing3 that of inquisitive sir-angers, or relators as
they are legally defined, who, under the shallow pretence of
correcting abuses, are rapidly undermining our national religion.
Who were the individuals Brathwait had to contend with is un-
certain: we only know that the Puritans of that day were as
pertinacious meddlers as the Dissenters are now ; and therefore,
probably, his rights and powers were sought to be wrested from
him by neighbours of that description. In March 1672-73 the
surviving Trustees elected Sir Christopher Wandesford, Bart.,
and Ma. Norton, Esq., in the room of William 'l'hornton and
Henry Darcy, deceased, as persons qualified according to the
will of the Donor, and as “ succeeding them in their estates in
the said parish ; ” and they at the same time approved, under
hand and seal, ‘⁶ Ralph Cottingham, Master of Arts‚ to be Master
of the F ree Schoole.'' It seems doubtful if the election was ad-
mitted ; and the right of appointment was warmly resisted. Mr
Norton in a letter to Mr Crosts, dated 12th April 1673, remarks ε
