of the same month in the parish church of Catterick,
where a neat mural monument was erected to his
memory on the north side of the chancel.
¹ He left behind him, says Wood‚ “the character
, of a well-bred gentleman and good neighbour;''
⁸ and there might be added, a consistent Christian*
and upright man. A description of his person has Ι
, descended orally‚ as also of his dreSS‚ by which the .
