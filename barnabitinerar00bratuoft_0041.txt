was a high—erowned one, and beyond what was corn-
mo'n in those days, when such hats were worn* His
equals in life bestowed on him the name of Dapper

⁴* An opinion has been entertained that the whole-length
figure introduced in the engraved title to the English Gentleman
represents the author. The first edition in 1630 exhibits the
rich dress of a courtier of that period: which in the third
edition, 1641, is altered 3 and the boots, spurS‚ sword, belt, and
cloak, show the heavy serviceable habiliments worn in those
formidable times by the warlike cavalier. He also wears in the
first a very broad-brimmed hat, and in the latter a remarkable
high-crowned hat :which may support the presumption‚ though it
does not prove it was a portrait of Brathwait. The following
passage, from a very uncommon tract, will show the value of
that article of dress when full triinmed :—“ I saw,” says the
author, “a complete Gentleman of late, whose Beuer-hat eost
xxxvii. s. a feather xx. s. the hatband iij. lz. and his ten double
Ruffe iiij. li..· thus the head and necke onely were fumished,
and that but of one suite, f)r ix. lz. xvii. s. Now taking the
proportion os the brauery for the rest os the body· , the cloak
liend with veluet‚ daubed ouer with gold lace two fingers broad,

1 the sattin doublet and hose in like sort decked, the silke stock-

ings, with costly garters hanging downe to the small of the legge,
the Spanish shooes with glittering roses, the girdell and Ste-
letto 3 I leaue it to those that herein know more than Ι, and
can speake of greater brauery than this, to cast vp the totall
summe: wherein also (as an appurtenant) they may remember
his Mistris suited at his charge, and cast vp both summes in one.
But on the contrary, Ι observed but 60 years since, generally a
man full as good or better in ability than this complete, lusty
looking lad, whose hat and band eost but vs. and his ruffe but
xiid. at the most. So you see the difference of these summes ;
the one ix.li. xvii.s. and the other vi.s. 'l'hen after this propor-
tion, the whole attire of the one cost abone 30 times as much as the
attire of the other; sorget not also that the one lasteth three times
as long as the other; subiect to change as sashions change . .

Of late the broad brimmd hat came suddainely' m sashion, and
put all other out of countenance and request3 and happy were
they that could get them soonest, and be first seene in that sashion ;
so that a computation being made, there is at the least 300000Ji. or
much more, in England onely bestowed in broad brimmd hats,
within one yeare and an halfe. As for others, either Beuer or
