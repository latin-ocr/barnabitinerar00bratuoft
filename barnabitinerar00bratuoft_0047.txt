memory by a well-warranted reprint of the Essczys
upon tlze E've semes, by the Editor of the Archaica.
To that reprint was prefixed a preface, which not only
contained some critical opinions on the merit of
Brathwait, but augmented the very imperfect list that Ι

glad to adopt his author Brathwait⁷s excuse on this
occasion, and say—

genuous candor, modestly to correct with a clear
censure all such either literal or material errors as
may obviously occur in the perusal of these subjects 3
