been press'd to death by errors.''

Well aware of my friend's variety of occupation,

both while resident at home, or rambling as a tourist‚

it may be some excuse to say, that at that moment, in
addition to the parliamentary business which commonly
engaged his mind, his time, strength, and zeal were

other without anger or peevishness, and abet without

Ι rudeness or incivility. It would as ill become me to
