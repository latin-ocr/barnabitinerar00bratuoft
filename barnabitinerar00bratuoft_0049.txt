dwell on his desects 3 his numerous publications are ι
before the world, and candid readers will judge of his
diversified talents and multifarious attaininents‚ with-
out reference to the mistake of a date, or dwelling on
the casual use of an imperfect original.

It is, Ι apprehend, on his general criticisms that
my friend relies for any valuable accession which his Ἴ
reprints may furnish to English literature. Of our ξ
author, he has cited several passages from his poems
to prove that ‘⁶ he was not altogether deficient in
poetical genius.'' He remarks in him, even from
those specimens, some strong characteristics which .
well agree with the author of Bar-nabee's Journal,
“their tendency to colloquial and vulgar allusion of Ξ

pose of blame, because it is intermixed with what is 3
“grave, and with passages of ele-gance and beauty.''
But he sums up his character in these words: ‘·It l
is rather as a miscellaneous writer, than for his poetical ,
merit, that we must place the claims of Brathwait to ’
revived notice. His Essays are ingenious, and some-
times almost eloquent, though too often fullos quaint-
ness and conceit‚ the great fault of his age. They
appear to me also to have another fault: they seem
to be written in a factitious temperament of mind and
feeling, which too many writers, and too many readers,
very erroneously suppose to be the warmth of genius.
It requires no artificial enthusiasm to relish the
touches which a pure and unprompted fancy exe-
cutes. There is a reflector in the bosom of mankind
always ready to receive and give them back.

“But in prose Brathwait shows himself a more than
ordinary master of a copious and polished phraseo-
logy, and abounds as well in sentiment as in the
stores of knowledge collected by various and extensive
reading.''
