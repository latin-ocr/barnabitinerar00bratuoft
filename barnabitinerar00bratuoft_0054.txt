THE FOVRTH
SONET.

Doest thou so fondly Ioue, and art not lou’de,
In louing those, who little care for thee?

If that thy fancie haue such fruites approu'de‚
I scorne to match with such imparity.

For wel I know a Prince may loue for lust,
'l‘hose eyes of thine, and then returne to dust-

If Rosamond had euer bene an hower,
Nere bene interred in her bed of earth,
If she had euer kept such vitall power,
As to smell sweet with her mellifluous breath‚
She had bene well excusde to chuse that state,
Which should be neere ecclipsde by mortall date.

For she poore wench did flourish for a while,
Cropt in the primrose of her wantonnesse,
And she that did the noblest thoughts beguile‚

Is now conuerted into rottennesse.
Thus doe we finde the truth of euery thing,
Sinne is a sinne euen in the noblest king.

For there is nought that can be esteemed so,
Deprzmde, deformde, as to apologize‚

A sinne actde by a Prince‚ but hence this woe,
Appeares in poets which doe temporize.

I will not sooth a Monarch for his crowne‚
But 1 must tell him, sinne will throw him downe.

Plutarch saith well, that he that bridle can
His fond affections‚ is halfe vertuous‚

But he that's wholy firme's an honest man,
His minde remaines certaine not impious‚
Nor tost with tempest of each breathing winde

But as a mirrour of a constant minde.

Hard things are pleasant, and those things appeare,
To be the best, which be the hardliest won,
