Then if repressing of fond lust thou feare,
To be too hard, yet being once begun,
A better relish it will yeeld to thee,
Then treasure had in great varietie.

One that should passe the Alpes, and hauing done,
Reposing him vpon some harbour low,
considers with what perill he begun,
And numbring them discursiuely in row,
Cannot but ioyfully be glad of this,
That he hath ended what his heart did wish.

How oft would he lie groueling on the ground,
And in a descant of his sweete repose‚

With ioyfull mirth and pleasure would abound
To haue transfreted such a Sea of woes.

And by recounting how he earst did creepe
Above those cliffes‚ he would fall fast asleepe.

So thou obtaining this so hard a maske,
Must needs be ioyfull in the victory,

To haue pure liquor in a purer caske,
Which might redound to minds felicitie.

And that same caske‚ that vessell thou doest beare,
Should have a crowne of glory, doe not feare.

Love not too high estates, for theyle despise
Thy poore estate brought downe to beggery,

Ayme at the lower ranke (if thou be wise)
For theyle acknowledge thy supremacie.

Yet' 1n my miride there' s e'nought can equall that,
To condescend vnto an equall state.

N either can boast of birth or parentage‚
Neither can brag of their too high estate,

But passe their daies of wofull pilgrimage‚
With like to like, the begger with his mate,

Irus though he be poore, yet rich in this,
Irus a begger, may a begger kisse.
