Ι from a fresh renewing spring euer distilling: Some
whereof the passionate Elegiacke offers to His neuer γ

dying nionument.''
“ The Argvrnent of this treatise ’² is given in prose,

followed by the pastorall of The Poct’s IVillow in ἶ
forty-sour eleven-line stanzaS. The Shepherds Tmolus, 1
ThyrsuS, Pelorus, Tyrnallus (the last two deceased), ·
and Berillus the hero, probably intended by our ¹

author sor his brothers and himself.
Amatory poenis to Eliza and Dorinda form the

remainder of the collection3'* from which may be “

selected, for novelty of measure, a short extract
frorn

T lte pensiue thoughts of Gaudio, in Sapphyclzs.

Rouze up thy spirit, (creature most inhumane)

Fix thy contentment on Elizaes beauty,

To which the wood gods tied are in duety,
Shame sall a coward.

How many Heroes haue adored her Image,
Passing a torrent of approaching danger?
More then Alcides for a Deyanyra

Ere made aduenture.

Let Hymenaeus who was euer present,
At thy solemnizd orisons be graced,
With an eternall monument of glory,
Leaue to be shamefast.

Shame may confound the shame to aster ages,

To let a cheerfull virgin lie beside thee,

And yet do nothing ; worst of ills betide thee :
Learne to be wanton.
