In “a Threnode occasioned vpon the Author's
discontent‚ in that he loue's yet cannot be respected ; '²
he declares nature subject to the universal passion,
as

The plants‚ the birds, the beasts‚ the fishes small,

Are made to Ioue : see how the iuy twines

Vpon the ruines of a skaled wall,

Or twist's about the wasts of fruitfull vines :
Ernbracing them with branches spreading broad,
Supporting them when grapes their scions load.

The louing turtle Ioues her faithfull make,

XVhom if she misse, she pines away and dies,

Abiuring rnirth and pleasure for his sake,

Filling the crispling aire with dolefull eries :
'l'he stock, the starling. and the sweet tun'd thrush‚
wil seek their makes through euery brake and bush.

The libbard‚ tigre, panther, beasts most wild,
Can be subdu'd by loue's sweet harmony,
‘l'ransform'd from sauage beasts to creatures mihi,
Oppress’d (as seems) with loue's extremity.

The cliuy mountaines‚ and the vales below,

By ecchoes shrill, their loue's pursuits doe show.

The skalie fishes in their watry clime,

¹ Tast of the fruit of loue, each in their kind,

Obseruing season, nature, course and time,

Such relish pleasures in loues passions find.
That languishing they fall away and die,
When they⁷r depriu'd of loue's society.
