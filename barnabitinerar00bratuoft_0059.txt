Ded. to the right worshipfull Richard Hvtton,

Sergeant at lawe.

“Treatises <right worshipful) of this kinde wee .

haue too few: of lascivious consequence too many;

l

and neuer was presse more oppressed with imperti· ;
nenceS. This subiect I composed for mine owne ξ
g priuate benefite, intending to engrosse it to my selse. g
But so many were the bonds of duety and affection, ,

in which Ι was tyed, and shall be euer, to you and

yours, as I could no way better expresse that intimate ⁴
z zeale I beare you, then in commending these peni· ἶ
’ tentiall Teares to your worthy acceptance. Teares -

they are, and drained from the Limbecke of a contrite
soule, which heartily groanes in spirit, laments her
sinneS, and with all feruencie desires to beare the
yoke of Christ: yea what affliction soeuer is laid
vpon hir, concluding with the Tragedian 3 Feras
non culpes quod vitare non potes: And this patience
not enforced neither, but proceeding from the in·
ward deuotion of the Soule, willing rather to faint
vnder the Crosse, then not to beare the Crosse‚'’—&C.
Α &C.—-“ Your worships in all duety to be commanded,
Rich. Brat.''

An excellent little work, written in animated lan-
3 guage, and evidently from the heart.
