VVhere Furies run diuision on my song :
Patience awhile, and thou shalt haue 't ere long.

The second part so announced, never appeared,
unless, as seems probable‚ the “ Furies run division ’' in
“the Wilde-man's measures '² which certainly appeared
“ere long.⁷' But the two works have no link of
continuatim, and the Wilde-man's measures hold no
common features, except as being satires‚ with the
Strappado. That might arise from the latter being ill
received and partly condemned from the circumstance
of the Title‚ which we gather from the Essay on De-
traction. Our author says : ‘⁶ Wonder I cannot chuse
(for else should I wonder at my owne stupidity) how
any should harbour the least conceit of an intended
Detractzbn by mee, or by my Labours, unlesse my
title of Devill imply so much, which may seem to
have affinitie with that which the Greeks terme διαίίολὴ,
Detraction.'' In 1625, ten years after the appearance
of the Strappado‚ this extract has the following mar-
ginal note: “ A pleasant poeme by the Author‚ long
since published3 and by some no lesse censoriously
than causelessly taxed.’'

Some of the poems in the Strappado are of con-
siderable length although entitled Epigrams, which is
thus explained—

I dare not bite, therefore to change my nature,
I call't an Epigram which is a Satire.
