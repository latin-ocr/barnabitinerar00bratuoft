The Laws of Drinking extend to eighty pages

without the introductory articles. Like the Itinerary
it was published without an author’s name and is now

chely: made up in pz'lls‚ compomzded qf Witty Ballads, Jovz'al
Songs, and Merry Catclzes.” [plate.]

These witty poems though sometime may seem to halt on Ι
crutches,

Yet thhey’ll all merrily please you for your charge, which not
mue is.

Prz'ntedggt Mer-Melanckolicus‚ lo be sold in London and West-
mmsler, 1 Ι.

 

 

It must be admitted the assumed name of Mer-Melancholicus

Α leaf prefixed to the ‘⁴ Laws of Drinking '⁵ is often wanting in

booke translated and entitled Jus Potandi, or the Law of Drink-
ing.'' Which Sculpture was addressed to his deserving Friend
and Exquisite artist‚ Mr Marshall.

persons are presented in Shipmens habits and capps; In their
actions carousing, gesticulating, reeling and hugging their Bona-

playing, they dancing. Alluding to the Elius, who used to pre-
sent their slaves drunken and shewing all their beastlinesse ;
purposely to deterre their Children from the like filthinesse.
