“To my worthy approved and judicious Friend‚

Alexander Riggby‚ Esquire, all generous content.

Assumpsits are Law-ties in Courts above,

So be Assumpsits in respect of Love 3

This hath induc'd rne, Sir, to render you,
Neare to my day, a tender of my due.

For in Gants aged-towne last time we met,

I promis'd you, and promises are debt,

To publish some choice subject in your name,
And in this Toy have I perform'd the same ;

garland stickt full of Tobacco-pipes‚ with glasses, vialls and other
proper utensiles‚ representing a Tobacco-shop to life.

within the shop, Partcloses or Partitions.

Three men discovered by a curtaine, and presented to the

2 halfe-body: The first, distinguished by the name of Captaine
ἑ Whiffe, with this impreze above his head ; Qui color albus erat :

This person is described with an amazed or surprised count’nance,
meagre and gastly3 whiffing Tobacco downe with these words
issuing out of the fumell of the pipe: lcum est z‘nvz'sera terra.
The second distinguished by the name of Captain Pipe, with a
long Tobacco-pipe at his mouth, with desperate Mouchato’s;
this impreze above his head: Quantum mutalus ab illo? with
these words steeming out of his Pipe : Fistula dulce canit. The
Third distinguished by the name of Captaine Snuffe, is described
by smoake issuing from his Nose abundantly ; edging his two
Consorts scomefully and bravingly ; this iinpreze above his head,
A nglus in AEtlziopem ; with these words flaming out of his pipe :
Mea messis in herba est.

No other posture appropriate to these, but only leaving [lean-
ing]‚ as persons taken with Migrim, upon one anothers shoulders.
All which are so to life described and artfully shadowed‚ as they
shall not need to be sartlier explaned.’'
