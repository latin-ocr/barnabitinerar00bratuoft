“This Manuscript falling into my hand, for the de· ¹
serving esteeme of the Author whose name it bore, Ι
communicated it to the serious perusall of sundrie Ι
judicious Censors, who highly approved the curious ,
concert andmvention of the Author: who composed j
it (as hee hath since ingenuously acknowledged) in his ¹

in the praise of the P. wherein is learnedly prov ed, and ς
by impregnable reasons evinced, that Tobacco is the ι
