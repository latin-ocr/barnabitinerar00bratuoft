C. in C.'' 1559, 8vo, is

A Satyricall E pigram 730ss tbhe wanton and excessiue vse
0 a acco,

It chaunc’d me gazing at the Tloeater,

To spie a Loek-Tabacco—Chevalier,

Clowding the loathing ayr with foggie sume

Of Dock-Tabacco, friendly foe to rume.

I wisht the Roman lawes seuerity : Alex. seu. Edict.

leo smoke selletlz, witlz smoke be done to dy

Being well nigh smouldred with this smokie Stir‚

I gan this wize bespeak my gallant Sir:

Certes, me thinketh (Sir) it ill beseems,

Thus here to vapour out these reeking steams :

Like or to Maroes steeds whose nosthrils flam'd3

Or Plinies Nosemen (mouthless men) surnam'd,

Whose breathing nose supply’d mouths absency.

He me regreets with this prophane reply :

Nay 3 1 resemble (Sir) Jehouah dread,

From out whose nosthrils a smoake issued :

Or the mid-ayrs congealed region,

Whose stomach with crude humors frozenon

Sucks vp Tabacco-like the vpmost ayr,

Enkindled by Fires neighbour candle fayr ε

And hence it spits out watry reums amaine,

As phleamy snow, and haile, and sheerer raine ε

Anon it smoakes beneath, it flames anon.

Sooth then, quoth I, it's safest we be gon,

Lest there arise some Ignis Fatuus

From out this smoaking flame, and choken us.
On English foole : wanton Italianly ;

Go Frenchly: Dutchly drink ε breath Indianly.
