demning the use of it. His own opinion of his labour
is given at the end in a marginal note—

“ Thus have I prov'd T obacco good or ill,
Good, if rare taken 3 bad, if taken still.”

Some verses follow as “Times Sonnet,” and the
volume ends with the following poem—-

Clzavcers incensed Ghost.

From the frequented path where Mortals tread‚
Old-aged CHAVCER having long retir'd‚
Now to revisit Earth at last desir'd‚

Hath from the dead rais'd his impalled head,

Of purpose to converse with humane seed,
And taxe them too, for bringing him o' th’ Stage
In writing that he knew not in his age

'Las; is it fit the stories of that book,
Couch'd and compil’d in such a various forme ;
Which art and nature joyntly did adorne‚
On whose quaint Tales succeeding ages look,
Should now lie stifled in the steems of smoak,
As if no poet's genius could be ripe
Without the influence of Pot and Pipe?

No, no, yee English Moors, my Muse was fed

With purer substance than your Indz'an weede ;

My breathing Nosethrils were from Vapors freede,
With Nectar and Ambrosia nourished,
While hospitality so flourished

In great mens Kitchins ; where I now suppose

Lesse smoake comes from their chimneyes than their

nose.

But 1 heare some prepar'd to question mee,

The reason why Ι am so freely bent

In such sad straines to publish my complaint‚
Or what strict Mamotlzrept that man should bee,

Who has done Chaucer such an injurie ;
Whose tongue, though weake, yet is his heart as strong,

To call them to account that did him wrong.
