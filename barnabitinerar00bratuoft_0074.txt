I’le tell it yee, and must expect redresse ;
Wold any of you hold it not a blot
To father such a brat hee never got ?

Or would he not ingenuously confesse,
Hee’d rather wish himselfe quite issue lesse?
Conceive this well 3 sor isit be a crime,

As sure it is, such is the case of mine.

 

Downe by a secret Vault as Ι descended‚
Pent in with darknesse save some little ray,
Which by a private cranie made his way,

By helpe whereof Ι saw what me offended,

Yet found no meanes to have the fault amended :
Fixt to a post, (such was poore Chaucers lot)
Ι found my name to that I never wrot,

And what might be the Subject ? no relation
Sad, solid, serious, morall, or divine,
Which sorted with the humours of my time,
But a late Negro's introduced fashion,
Who brought his drugs here to corrupt our Nation :
'Gainst which, because its used in excesse,
My Muse must mount, that she may it suppresse.

Now some may well object, as many will,
This taske addes rather glory to my name,
Than any way seemes to impaire the samej,
But Ι say no ; Chaucer would thinke it ill
To plant Tobacco on Parnassus hill:
Sacred the Synod of the Muses bee,
Nor can such weeds spring from Apollo's tree.

BesideS, what danger might Prescription bring ἔ
For had the use of it been knowne to me,
It might have pleaded well antiquitie ;
But th' Poets of my time knew no such thing,
How could they then of such a subject sing?
No ; th' age we liv'd was sorm'd of milder stuffe,
Then to take ought, like Malecontents, in snuffe.
