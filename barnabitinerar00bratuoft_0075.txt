Pure are the crystall streames of Hippocrene3

Choice the dimensions which her Bards expresse ;

Cleare is their heart as th' Art which they professe:
How should they relish then ought that's uncleane‚
Or waste their oyle about a smoaky dreame?

farre bee't Minerva should consume her Taper

In giving life or lustre to a Vapor.

The TALES* I told, if morally applide‚
How light soe're‚ or wauton to the show,
Yet they in very deed were nothing so ;
For were the marke they aym’d at but descride,
Even in these dayes they would be verifide ;
And like Sybillas Oracles esteem'd,
W’orth worlds of wealth, how light soe're they seem'd.

Witness my Μίίίεν, and my Carpenter‚
The amorous stories of my Wise ofb’allz,
Which such variety of humours hath ;
My Priour‚ Asancz'ple, and Alllzoner,
My subtile S muner, and the fllessenger;
All which though moulded in another age,
Have rais'd new subjects both for Presse and Stage.

Yet note these times disrelishing my tongue,
Whose Idioms-distaste by nicei· men
Hath made me mince it like a Citizen Ξ
Which Chaucer holds a manifest wrong,
To force him leave what he had used so long ε
Yea, he dislikes this polishing of art,
Which may refine the Core, but spoiles the heart.

But yet in serious sadnesse I impute

This to no fate or destiny of mine,

But to the barraine Brain-wormes of this time 3
&Vhose Muse lesse pregnant‚ present or acute,
Affording nought that with the age can sute‚

Like to the truant Bee, or lazie Drone,

Robbe other Bee-hives of their hony-combe.

ὗ Whose pleasing Comments are shortly to bee published.
