And which is worse 3 this worke they make their owne, ¹
Which they have pruned, purged, and refin'd.
And aptly form'd it to the Author’s mind 3

When I'm assured, if the truth were knowne,

= They reape the crop which was by others sowne ε

Yea, theese usurpers to that passe are brought,

They'l foyst in that wee neither said nor thought.

This, this it was incens'd old Chauceffs Ghost,
And caus'd him vent his passion in this sort,
And for a while to leave th' Elysian Court‚

W'here honest Authors are esteemed most :
Excluded are, enjoyn’d by Fate to won
Vpon the scorching banks of Phlegeton.

Yee then, whose measures merit well the name
And Title yee retaine‚ Poets‚ I meane,

Bedew'd with infiuence from Hippocrene,

, As yee professants seeme‚ so be the same,

’ And with your own pennes eternize your fame z l
Shun these Pz'pe-Pagecznt5; for there seldom come j
Tobacco-Factors to Elysium. 2

‘²‘ Mr Bindley possessed a remarkable fine and perfect copy ff
of these pieces (afterwards in the possession of George Hibbert, Ξ
Esq.)‚ and in a manuscript note he pronounced ‘it one of the ἶ
scarcest books in England: having never met with ye Title in :
any catalogue. The plates by Marshall (he adds) are exceed- ἒ
ingly well done for that time (viz. 1617) and are, I arn apt to be· ¹
lieve, ye earliest productiori of that Engraver. Ι. B.’ ⁴

Upon this it may be observed that the volume very rarely ·'
contains the engravings and descriptions, and is seldom entered ἓ
correctly in the catalogues, which probably misled my late θ
valued friend, whose universal knowledge and accuracy on such
points may remain unquestionable, although the possessors of Ι .
the Laws of Drinking and Smoaking must not indulge in be· »3¹

lieving it ‘ one os the scarcest books in England.’
