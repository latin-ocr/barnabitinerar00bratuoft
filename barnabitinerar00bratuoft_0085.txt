Francis Dueket Knight3 his best wishes.

'So many kinde respects haue I had showne

From you and yours‚ that if you were mine owne
As you are mine ; sor what can be more neere,
Then Loue and Blood contracted in one Spheere?
Ι could not prize Loue at a higher rate,

Nor to my selfe more kindnesse vendicate :

In lieu whereof‚ (but ’lasse th' requitall's small)

I tender you this Spring, and this is all :
W'herein, if ought tune fitly with the Time,

I'ue stil'd it Yours, it shall no more be mine.

Yours in all respectiue Ioue,
MVSOPHILVS.

Kbon tlze new Spring.

A new Spring's found which cureth most diseases;
It eleeres the Eye—sight, and the Bladder eases‚
Itzcooles the Stomacke‚ and it cheeres the Heart,
And giues free passage to th' digestiue part,

It recombines the Sinnewes too, some say,

And makes the Cripple throw his Crutch away.
