So as there's none that iustly can complaine them,
Since both a Knight* and 's Spring doe entertaine thern.

Hee, out of Loue and Bounty mixt together,
lt by it's Virtue healing such come thither.
O that the Reader could like Vertue finde
In my New Spring, to cure the griefes of minde,
But much I feare me, if it had like Force,
The Bodies case would make my Spring tast worse.

An Elegie which the Author entituleth
BOUND YET FREE.

Speaking of the benefit of imprisonment.

Thou, whom we call lifes death, Captiuity
Yet canst contemplate in the darkest Cell
1 Of things aboue the reach of Vanitie
Dost in my judgement Liberty exce113
Ι In that thou teachest man to mortifie
Ι His indisposed passions ; and canst well
Direct him how to mannage his estate,
Confin’d to th' narrow prospect of thy Grate.

Hee sees the passage of this Globe of earth,
And makes right vse of what his sight partakes
Some he obserues expresse a kinde of mirth,
Of which he this due application makes;
If they did know the misery of Birth
With Death's approach, they would not hazard stakes
Of Soules eternall glory, for a day
Of present ioy, which one houre takes away.

Others he heares hemoning of the losse

Of some deare friend ; or't may be not so well
Decrease of fortune, or some other crosse,

Which to forgoe they deeme a second hell,
(So firmely fixed be their mindes on ydrosse)

As nought smels well but what of gaine doth smell.

*t Sir Edward Bellingham, a knight of extended bounty and
cur esie.
