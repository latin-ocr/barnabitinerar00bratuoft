These he condemnes, and proues it euery way,
The captiu’st wretch 's in better state then they.

Others he notes obseruing os the time,
Meere Fashion—inongers‚ shadowes of the great 3
And tIhese attendauce giue where th' Sunne doth
Aristfllxilege to Isis Asse admire the Seat
More then the Person, 'cause the robes be fine
That hang about it : and hee doth intreat
Theifi absence3 for, “These cannot well (saith

Others as base and farre rnore dangerous
Notes he, :is Politician Machauels
&Vho count that gaine which is commodious
Adhering to themselues‚ and to none els :
For these make ancient houses ruinous,
And Charitie from out the Realme expels,
Reducing th’ Orphans teare and Widdowes curse
To th' damn’d Elixie of their well-cramm‘d purse. Ι

Others he notes, and they would noted be 3
For painfing, purfling, smooffling, certesing‚
Shew they would be obseru’d for vanitie,
Staruing their Soules by bodies cherishing,
And these hee laughes at for their foolery ;
For while they put the Case to garnishing,
That Shell of frailty, they're indifferent
What shall become of th' Soule the instrument.

Others there be which seeme least what they are,
Pretending truth in salshood, and doe gull
The world with shadow‚ yet doth he compare
The passage of euents‚ and finds at full
Their end's attended with an endlesse care,
And th’ pregnant wit which seemes so smooth
proues dull,
NVhen thousand Testates shall produced be,
For to disclose their close hypocrisie.
