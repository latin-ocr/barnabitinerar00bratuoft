Ought 16556 ; nay inore Ξ for we approue as true
&Vhat the deuine Morall taught. That one may
haue
A fuller and more perfect interuiew
Of the Starres beauty in a hollow Caue
Then on the Superficies ; for the shew
Of pompe distracts our passions, and doth slaue
Our reason to our sense 3 whence we may know,
The dangers of high states are seene below.

Below 3 and what more low then to be shut
From open ayre, strang'd from the sight of Men,
Clos'd in obliuion, linl<ed hand and foot
Least their escape gaine liberty Ρ what then
Shall this enthrall my soule ? it cannot doo't,
It does aspire aboue the thoughts of them
Who shed their Childish teares when they are
sent
By higher powers to take them to restraint.

 

The truth of things (saith sage Democritus)
Lies hid in certaine Caues, that is, the Cell
Of 'shraldome which restraines and limits vs,
Which makes vs happy if we vse it well
For we're sequestred from th' pernicious
Objects of earth, and may in priuate tell
What we in publike were, where we doe finde,
The freest man may haue the slauish’st minde

For my experience tells me th’ Act of Sin,
Proceeds from sinnes occasion ; which restrain'd,
To meditate Soules freedome we begin,
And flie from earth when th' Body is enchain'd
Making our thoughts contemplators of Him,
Vv'hom if we get we haue sufficient gain’d :
So as the Grate of our Captiuity,
Is th' Gate that opens to soules liberty.

Whence 'tis we see so many tast the ayre
Of freedome, with neglect of what they are 3
