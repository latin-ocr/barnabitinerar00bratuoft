Making their will their Law 3 but when they share
Their portion in affliction, then their care
Is in the honour of that inward faire,
And they lament the state wherein they were :
For Man in state forgets himselfe and his,
Till his affliction tells him what he is.

If life indeed were such a Jubile,
That euery houre, day, yeare, did promise vs
Continuate health, and wealth, and liberty,
Then had we better reason to excuse
The loue we haue to our mortality z
But since wee see we cannot will nor choose‚
But must be rest of these, why should we grieue, ἱ
To leaue as men what men are forced to leaue ?

Nor skills it much were we bereft of these,
VVhether in Thrall or Freedome, but of th' two
I'de rather lose my fortune where I cease‚ ’
To make resort to any, and must know
No more of th’ World or the Worlds prease ;
But am retired from the publike show
Of this fraile Theatre ; and am confin’d
In Flesh to tast true liberty of Minde.

i
A Minde as free as is the Body thrall, Ι
Transcendent in her being, taking th’ wings
Of th’ Morning to ascend, and make that all
Of her's immortali, sphearing it with Kings
XVhose glory is so firme it cannot fall:
VVhere euery Saint in their reposure sings
Th' triumphant Paean of eternity,
To Him whose sight giues perfect Liberty.
ι

Then whether my restraint enforce or no,
Ile be myselfe, but more in my restraint ;
Because through it I see the end of woe,
Tasting in griefe the Essence of content :
That when from this same double-ward I goe,
This same entangled Prison 3 th' continent
