T lle Shepheards Holy-day, reduced in apt measures to ,
Hobbz'nalls Gallz‘zzrd, ον Jolm to tlze [isay-pole.

Mopso. Corne Marina, let's away,
For both Eride and Bridegroome stay,
Fie for shame, are swaines so long,
Pinning of their head-geare on ?
Pray thee see, None but we,
Mongst the swaines are left vnreadie‚
Fie, make hast, Bride is past,
Follow me and Ι will leade thee.
Δίαν. On my louely Mopsus, on,
I am readie‚ all is done,
From my head vnto the foote,
Ι am fitted each way to't ;
Buskins gay, Gowne of gray, Ι
Best that al] our fiocks do render, ,
Hat of stroe, Platted through, ἶ
Cherrie lip and middle slender.
svsop. And I think you will not find ,
Mopsus any whit behind, Ι
For he Ioues as well to go, A
As most part of shepheards do. Ι
Cap of browne, Bottle-crowne, 1
With the leg I won at dancing,
And a pumpe Fit to iunipe,
XVhen we shepheards fall a prancing.
And Ι know there is a sort
Will be well provided for’t,
For I heare, there will be there,
Liueliest swaines within the shere:
Ietting Gill, Iumping Will, ῑ
Ore the fioor will haue their measure: ἑ
Kit and Kate, There wil] waite
Tib and Tom will take their pleasure.
Mar. But Ι feare3
Alop. What doest thou feare?
Mar. Crowd the fidler is not there:
And my mind delighted is,
With no stroake so much as his.
