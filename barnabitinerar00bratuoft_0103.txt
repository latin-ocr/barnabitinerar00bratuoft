She chats and chants but ayre,
A windie vertue sor the eare,
'Tis lighter farre then care,
And yet her songs do burthens beare.

She dances, that’s but mouing‚

No heauie vertue here she changes,
And as her heart in louing,

So her seete inconstant ranges.

She softly leanes on strings‚
She strikes the trembling lute and quauers:
These are no weightie things,

Her strokes are light, so are her fauours.

Those are her vertues fitting to her kind,
No sooner showne, but they turn'd all to wind.

Then to you, O sexe of sethers‚

On whose browes sit all the wethers‚

I send my passion weau'd in rimes,

To weigh downe these light emptie times.

The last division of this volume has for title

20. His Odes .· or Flzz'lomels T eareS.

Odes in straz‘nes os sorrow tell

The Odes were selected by Sir Egerton Brydges in
1815, as a specimen of the genius of our author, and
as proving “him not to have been without merit, ;
either for fancy, sentiment, or expression.” The ¹
reprint was in small octavo, and formed one of the 4
limited series of works‚ so tastefully embessished, that
issued from the private press at Lee Priory.
