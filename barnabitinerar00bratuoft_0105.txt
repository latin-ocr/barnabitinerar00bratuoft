Poems, ficll os all genereus delzgrlzt5 by Richard Bratlz-
vvayte, Esquire.

Licet toto nunc Helicone frui. MART.

Dee not looke on me with a carelesse eye,
First read and iudge‚ tlzcn buy, or else goe by.

Laneion, printed by John Dawson sor John Bellamie,
and are lo be sould at tlte south cnlrance of llce lx‘oyall Ι
Exn-hange. 1621.” ¹i

By the table of “the number and order of these ⁹
Epigrams‚'' or rather poenis, they are divided into
two partS, containing eight and thirteen pieces‚ and
dedicated in rhyme: “to my trvely worthie and '
mvch respected friend, Sr. Thomas Gainsford, ἔ
Knight.’'

For the sake of the versification coming near in
measure to that adopted in the Itinerary, we select,
from the first part-

Cares Cure, or afiggfor Care.

Happie is that State of his,

Takes the World as it is,

Loose hee honour, friendship, wealth,

Loose hee libertie or health‚

Loose hee all that Earth can giue,

Hauing nought whereon to liue, ⁸
So prepar'd a mind's in him,

Hee's resolu'd to sinke or swim.

Some will pule if they but heare,
How next Summer will be dearc,

As th' Engrosser who doth heape
Graine, laments when it is cheape,
Gallants who haue run their race

In all ryot, feare the Mace ;

Punkes whose trunkes of lucre smell,
Feare the Bridewell more then Hell.
