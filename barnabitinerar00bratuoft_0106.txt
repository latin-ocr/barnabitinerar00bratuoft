But when I remember these,
Hermon, and Hermocrales,
Phedon Menedemus, then

1 conclude they were no men:
For where's Reason in that Else,
Who for pelfe will hang himselfe3
Valuing more this filmie rinde,
Then the glory of his Minde!

Shoulde I ought deiected bee

’Cause blind Fortune frowns on me,
Or put finger in the eye

When Ι 566 my Damon die,

Or repine such should inherit

More of honour then of merit,

Or put on a sourer face,

To see vertue in disgrace l

Should Ι to see Justice dead

Like a bull-rush hang my head,

Or lament to see the time

Guided by a crooked line,

Or bewaile my houre of Birth‚

That Content⁷s exil'd from earth,

Or vie teares with graines of sand
’Cause Oppression soakes our Land !

Should I weepe when I doe trie
Fickle Friends inconstancie‚

Quite discarding mine and mee
When they should the firmest be,

Or thinke much when barraine hrains
Are possest osrich Demains,

When in Reason it were fit

They had wealth vnto their wit Ξ

Should I grieue to see a knaue
More respect and credit haue,
Then a sincere honest man

Who nor sooth nor humour can,
Or distast men of desert

Should haue least in Fortunes part,
