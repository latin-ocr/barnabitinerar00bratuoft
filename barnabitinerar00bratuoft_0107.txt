35

When men high but worthlesse great
Many times vsurpe their seate Ξ

Should Ι sorrow to behold

Nought so much admir'd as gold,
Or looke foule that such a Swad
Should gaine her I would haue had,
Or bernone (but all in vaine)

What Ι cannot get agrame,

Or looke wan that others store
Through iniustice makes me poore !

Should Ι spend the morne in teares
'Cause Ι 566 my neighbors eares

Stand so slopewise from his head,

As if they were hornes indeede :

Or to see his wife at once

Branch his brow, and breake his skonce‚
Or to heare her in her splene

Callet like a butter-queane Ξ

Should Ι sigh because Ι 566

Lawes like spider-webbs to be,
Lesser fiies are quickly tane

While the great breake out agrame,
Or so many schismes and sects
Which foule heresie detects‚

To suppresse the fire of zeale

Both in Church and Common weale Σ

Should Ι weepe to see some write
To adde fuell to delight‚

But no taske to vndertake

Any time for conscience sake 3
Or to mourne to see the Doue
Ever censur'd for her loue,

While the Puttock flies away
Priuiledg’d what ere he say Ξ

Should I grieue when I’me in place
That my foe should be in grace,
