Or in silent woe lament
At my friends his discontent,
Or repine that men of worth

Should want meanes to set them forth,

Or disdaine my wench should be

³. Kinde to any one but me l

Should Ι blind my eyes with teares
Or oppresse my heart with stares,
When nor teares nor seares auaile
Such whose choicest comforts faile,
By conuerting that sweet ayre

Of delight vnto despaire,

For I know no enter breath

Limits these, saue onely Death 2

Should I sigh for that Ι see
World goes not well with me,
Or inveigh 'gainst envious Fate
Still to lowre on my Estate,

Or reproue such as expresse
Nothing saue vnthankfulnessjf
Or expose my selfe to griefe
'Cause my woes are past reliefe !

Should I grieue because I giue

No contentment where I liue,
Though my best endeuours proue
That my actions merit Ioue,

Or repine at others ayme

Gaining more then 1 can gaine,
When their vaine mis-guided course
Showes their humour to be worse Ξ

Should Ι pine away and die

Or my Childish teares descrie
'Cause my neighbors are vntoward,
Wilfull wife, and seruants froward,
Or exclaime 'gainst destenie

Who so crossely matched mee,

Or desire no more to liue

Since Ι liue the more to grieue !
