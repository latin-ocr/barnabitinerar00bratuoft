Should I moui-ne, moine, or mone
To be left distrest, alone,

Or wish death approching nie

With a bleered blubb'red eye,
’Cause my meanes Ι scarce can fmd
Of proportion with my minde‚

Or breath sadly ’cause 1ny breath
Drawes each minute neerer death !

No there's nought on Earth Ι feare
That may force from rne one 16316,
Losse of honour, fredome, heahh,
Or that mortall idoll, wealth‚

With these babes may grieued be
But they haue no power ore me,
Lesse my substance lesse my share
In my feare and in my care.

Feare he must that doth possesse,
Least his substance should grow 16556,
Which oft driues him to extrearnes
Both in broken sleepes and dreames‚
But so little doe 1 care

For these Fetlzers in tlte ayre,

As I laugh while others grieue

Louing these which they must leaue.

Wretched moles who pore on earth,
And conceiue no taste of mirth‚

But in hoording heape on heape
What's the fruit in end they reape‚
Saue returning to that slime

Which they tugg'd for all their time?
Sure 1 am, reduc'd to clay,

Poorest are as rich as they.

Care I would, but not for this
'Cause it lessens care of blisse 3
Yet not so as not to care,

What we spend, or what we spare,
For this carelesse course we 6311
Meerely vaine and prodigall 3
