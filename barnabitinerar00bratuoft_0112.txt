A short analysis of the contents of this volume, for
the purpose of detecting imperfect copies, may not
be unacceptable. In conjunction with the Compleat
Gentlewoman, which forms a second part, no work
of that ³age can have been more uniformly read, or
higher appreciated.

On opening the volume, it exhibits a glowing
specimen of the burine of Ro. Vaughan, in ten
compartments for the Frontispiece, with a folding
broadside prefixed as an explanatory draft of
same. The printer's title as above is followed by
nine leaves of Dedication‚ copious tables, and other
matter. After p. 456 is a sheet without pagination‚
