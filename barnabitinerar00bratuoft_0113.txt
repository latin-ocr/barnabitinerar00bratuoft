ἢ· E mbleme.

With a Climacz‘ericle yeere this worke began,
Which is exprest when Sev'ns and Nines doe meet,
Held fatall to this short-spun threed of man ς

And with same number ends the final sheet

Of these Observances, whereos Ι treat τ

Threescore and three is held the dangerous yeare,
And just so many sheets shall you find here3

But not a leafe to give a life to seere.

of a moment's reflection to unravel. Here the riddle-my-ree is
to discover a year where the unison of the numbers divides by
9 and 7. That exists with all the puny quibbling of a three-
sold solution in 1627, if thus dissected :—9 and 7 are 16, and
3 times 9 is 27. Again, 1 and 6 is 7, while 2 and 7 make 9 ε
or by adding all the figures of the year together it produces 16,
or 9 and 7. This Lilliputian labour shows that the author was
rather more than three years completing the work, as in the
fourth (1631) it was published.

Again. The Printer's alphabet, or signatures, has no more
than twenty-four letters, as J and W are seldom used. In the
English Gentleman the signatures end in the third alphabet at
Qq q, making sixty-two sheets 3 and the duplicate N n n, above

It rarely happens that an enigmatical trifle like this is worthy i
described, completes the “ threescore and three.’'
