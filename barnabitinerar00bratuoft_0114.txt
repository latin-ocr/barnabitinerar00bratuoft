Ι table. After p. 221 is the character of “A Gentle-
woman‚'' four leaves, not paged, the “Embleme’'⁷”‘
and “Vpon the Errata’' two more. Some copies
have an “Appendix vpon a former supposed Im-
pression of this title‚'' consisting of five leaves with
signature in continuation, but not paged.

’χ’ E mbleme.
Some hold these Obseruatz‘ons to be long,
Some more iudicious‚ hold them to be short,
Thus are they censur'd be they right or wrong 3
What should we then make Censure but a sport,
Since good or bad, we're ne're the better sor't?
Which to attemper‚ 1 should thinke it best,
Vertue were Censor in each Authors breast.
