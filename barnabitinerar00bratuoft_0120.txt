intitled 5 A proper new Ballad, to tlze tune ofBrczga-

¹ deary round. Which his Chantcleere sings with

varietie of ayres (having, as you may suppose, an
instrume“tall Polyphon in the cranie of his nose.)
Now he counterfeits a natural Base, then a perpetuall
T reble‚ and ends with a Counter-tenure. You shall
heare him feigne an artfull straine through the Nose,
purposely to insinuate into the attention of the purer
brotherhood. But all in vaine, they blush at the
abomination of this knave, and demurely passing by
him, and call him the lost clzz'lde. Now, for his
Author, you must not take him for one of those

ἶ pregnant criticke Suburbane wits, who make worke
ἶ for the fidlers of the Citie. For those are more
ζ knaves, than fooles, but these quite contrary. In

those you shall finde salt, sense, and verse: but in
these none of all three. What then is to hee ex-
pected from so sterile a Pernassian, where impudence
is his hest conductor, Ignorance his best Instructor‚
and Indigence his 11551 Proctor? Shall we then close
with him thus? Hee 15 constantin nothing but his
Clothes. He never casts his slough but against
Bartholomew F aire ἦ where hee may casually en-
danger the purchase of a cast suite: Else, trust
me, hee 15 110 shifter. In a word, get his poore
corpes a sheete 10 shrowd them in at his dying they
get more than his Muse could ever make him worth
while hee was living.

ἦ Of a Zealous Brother we are told: “No season through
all the yeere accounts hee more subject to abhomination than
Bartholomew-faire: Their Drums, Hobbihorses, Rattles,
BabieS, Jew-trumpS, nay Pigs and all are wholly Judaicall.
The very Booths are Brothells of iniquity, and distinguished by
the stamp of the Beast. Yet under favour, hee will authorize
his Sister to eate of that uncleane and irruminating beast, a
pig, provided that this pig bee sat, and that himselfe or some

other zealous Brother accompanie her: and all this is held for
authentick and canonicall.⁷'
