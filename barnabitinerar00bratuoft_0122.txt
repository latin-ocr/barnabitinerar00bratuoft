prety thing to observe how hee carries his Trinkz'lo’s i
about him: which makes the Countrey Choughs ἶ
esteeme him a man of prize. A Countrey Rush-
bearing, or morrice Pastorall, is his festivallzss‘ if
ever hee aspire to plum-porridge, that is the day. ι
, Here the Guga-girles gingle it with his neat nifles: .
ἶ while hee sculkes under a Boothe‚ and showes his i
wit never till then, in admiring their follies. He has l
an obscene veine of Ballatry‚ which makes the l
Wenches of the Greene laugh 3 and this purchaseth

the Minsticll, and most heroically break his Drone, because the
Drone cannot rore out his tune. The wenches poore soules
ι shake in their skinnes‚ fearing a mischiese: and intreat their
sweethearts to give him sair language. All is out a square
while hee is there. But these are but his rurall pageants.''

Another guise the Zealous Brother: “ He keeps a terrible
quarter in his sinnefull Synodalls and denounceth an heauvie
woe upon all W'akes, Summerings‚ and Rush-bearings: pre-
ferring that act whereby Pipers were made rogues by Act of
Parliament‚ besore any in all the Acts and Monuments.’'
