Rev. ofA 2. Niobe.

I'le not invoke‚ as others use,

The influencc of any Muse3

The „Muses nine shall be no other,

Than Orphans nine to mone their Mother.

A 3. A nm'r'crsaries upon lzis Pcznaretc.

XVepe ! no ; Ι will not ε yt would ease mine heart ;

The burden of my griefes shal beare a part

In sadder Straines : &till-running Rivers are

Ever the deepest : Not a teate shall share

In my discomsort τ They that can allay

Their griefes with teareS, are mourners for a day.
Nor will I cast my sorrowes on my hacke,

Nor cloath them, as our Painters vse, in blacke ;

Such clothing‘s meere dissembling ε many weare

A sable habit, and distill a teare‚

who can dispense with griese : which I detest ;

Though Pt‘clures be by Slzadowes best exprest

To native Symmetrie: we cannot so

Paint our essential Portraiture of Woe.

The poet goes on to compare himself with Niobe,

the Pelican, the T urtle, and

The chaste choice bird Porphyrio, left alone
(Rest of his mate) converts his mirth to mone ;
Famine’s his sood, darke silence his repose‚

Lost Love the loome, his Life the webbe of woes.
Retir'd hee lines, not seene converse with any,
His comforts few, his discontentments many ;
Dew-trickling temes, like christall rills distill,
Which forme a funeral habit to his will ;

To live he loaths‚ sor while he lives he tries
Nought good in life, till it expires and dies.

If Birds oth’ aire such heavie aires send forth,
Deepe-drain'd must mine be, or they'r little worth.

Had his lost consort resembled the generality of
women,
