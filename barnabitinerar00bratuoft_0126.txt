Had she beene, like too many of our nation‚
Expos'd to riot‚ or engag⁷d to fashion,-&⁹c. &a

Had shee beene such, by all mine hopes, I vow,

Ι should haue mourn'd in clothes, as others doe,
And with a sable habit cloth'd my skin,

But worne a cheerefull nuptiall robe within ;

And ioy'd like those, who, when the storme is done,
Refresh themselves in seeing of the sunne.

Yea, ere th' rosemary sprigs and fragrant fiowers
Stucke on those ashy corpse, which once were ours,
Should lose their beauty or their odor sweet,

Or moth or worme should pierce her shrouding sheet,
I'd dride my teares, clozing her obits thus,

“Adieu ἶ th'art fitter farre for Earth than us.’'

None such was mine 1 her vertues were too pure
To seed fond fancy with a forraine lure.

Fixt was her eye on Heav'n, while ev'ry sense

In doing good strove for preeminence.

In distinct houres shee would divide the day,

To walke‚ write, worke, to meditate and pray:

Her first fruits were for Heav'n ; her second cares
Pitcht their resolves on temporall affaires :

For mine held Time of higher estimate

Than to expose it at so vile a rate

As to bestow’t on trifles ε

But leaving these, Dear Mvse relater be

Of her descent and honour'd Familia ,·

Ennobled by her spotlesse vertuous name,

To prove those ancestors from which she came.
Neere Darlington was my Deare Darling borne

Of noble house, which yet beares Honors forme,

T eese-seated Sed-bomne, where by long descent

Cogniers were Lords, their countries ornament ;

Wnich by that ancient monument appeareS‚

Rear'd in the chancell there for many yeares ;

VVhere th’ ancestor such an exploit perform’d,

As hee by fame and victory adorn'd,

Made his successours glorious, which Ι wish

(And crowne my wishes Heav'n 3> may live in his :
