Meane time 1 this relation will omit,
Because elsewhere * I have recorded it.
But what’s a Family but style or name,

anesse preserved by a vertuous Fame ,ἲ

And this she had, which did perfume her life,

(Like a most precious odor) maid and wife. f

Pure were her thoughts3 her actions without staine,

Grace was her guide, and godlinesse her gaine.

She breathes not that liv'd freer from suspect,

Nor courted vanity with more neglect 3

Pride was her scorne, Hurnilitie her prize,

And Heav'n the object where she fixt her eyes.

Yea, there was nought on Earth she more did love

'l‘han Fame by realgoodnesse to improve ε

So as, ev’n those which knew her by report,

Admir'd that which they heard, and sam’d her for 'tz

Teares trickling stream'd srf) neighbors eyes ; exprest

Those silent sorrowes treasur’d iu their brest: ⁸

While with joynt voice, made hoarse through griefe, they Ι
eride, ¹

‘⁴ None ever liv'd more lov’d, or moaned, dide.’'

 

This compound of all virtue was modest in her
ξιῖῖῖιῗ, neat, and apparelled according to her station Ι
m ie—

 

Her maxime us'd to be
“ She weares best clothes, that weares to her degree.”

For to describe her Person, which shall be,
As was her selfe‚ compos'd of modestie,
Her beauty was her owne, a native red
Got by a modest blush, her tincture‚ fed
Byfeare and fancy ,· no complexion bought
From shop e're toucht her Astape, nor euer wrought
On her affection ; rather high than low
Appear'd her stature, that the age might know

³⁶ In his Remaines after Deatlz.
