Nature did owe her nothing, taking care
To make her proper, as her forme was faire.

Let it suffice, nought could in woman be,

If good, were not in her espous⁷d to me.

Chast was my choice, so choice, as ne're was bred

A sweeter consort both for boord and bed.
Resides, where e⁷re I walke, Ι gather thence

Apparent tokens of her provideam .·

Although I seeke her whom I cannot find,

I find inventions of her pregnant mind

Exprest in ev'ry arbour: quick conceite

Steer'd by discretion to support a state ;

Without too much restraint or libertie,

Not domineering in a familie,

Nor too remisse ; nor lavish, nor too spare ;

Carefull‚ yet wise to moderate her care 3

Rich in a frugall bounty, while content

Smil'd on her brow, whether she spar’d or spent.

So as, in all domesticall affaires

So sweetly mixt were her well-temper'd cares,

As if she had beene from her childhood bred

And th' Oeconomz'cks solely studied.

Nor did her cautious providence extend

W'holly to thoughts of fraihy, which take end

From time and mutability3 O, no !

She thought of th' place, whereto all mortals go.

Brathwait then relates that his lost wife had her
shroud constantly before her, to remind her of the
preparation for death. He then celebrates her needle-
work 3 not only the numerous garments wrought by
her hand for the poor, but numerous patterns of rich
needle-workes‚ which ancient use

Approves to store and beautifie an house.

It were easy to make a much longer transcript
from the conclusion of the tract, for it is really very
well written and does great honour to the character
