Sign. A 3, Dedication wishes : “To the Honoraffle,
Edward Somerset, Lord Herbert, my most noble and
accomplish'd Lord ,- Treasures of Comforts‚ after these
Tributes of teares.

Back of sign. A 3 is a quatrain to illustrate the
name of Elisabeth Herbert in the Anagrarn of
“Heere a blest birth.” The Elegy is comprised in
294 lines, from which the following extract, by the
allusion to that part of the metropolis as was then the

Tell me, thou State-surrounded STRAND, canst finde
Through all thy prospects a selecter minde

Cloath'd in a choicer dresse Ξ Pray, looke about,
Thou canst not chuse but see some face peepe out
T' attract the forc'd spectator ; but that skin

Is it so sleel-:e as 't has no staines within ?

Is it a native tincture? does it wooe

The gazer without art? or if it doe,
