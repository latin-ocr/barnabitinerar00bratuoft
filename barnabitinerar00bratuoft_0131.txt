The splendor of her beauty or her blood?

Can it converse with fashion, and appeare
Discreet in her election what to weare?

When hee on Stage to force some passion carne,
Had his Sonnes ashes in an Urne enshrin'd

To worke more deepe impressions in his mind.
The Emblem’s good : this Fun'rall pile of ours.
Strucke passion in each line address'd to yours.
