Upon these M z'scellane Medz'tatz'ons, with otker mix-t
Suby‘ects, conteined in tlzz‘s precedent Tract; a clozing
Sonnet.

Morall mixtures or Divine,
Aptly cull'd and couch'd in order,
Are like colours in a shrine,
Or choice flow'rs set in a border,
Or like dishes at a Feast,
Each attended with his sanet,

ξ To delight the curious Guest,

j And give relish to his palat.

Store of colours they are meet,

When wee should ones picture take,

One choice flow’r bee't neere so sweet,
ἑ Would no pleasing posie make,
⁴ One Dish be it neere so precious

To the sceut or to the tast,

Though at first it seeme delicious,

It will eloy the sense at last.

Here are Colours permanent,
Objects which will cheere the eye,
Here are flowers redolent,

Which will bioome and never dye ε
Here are Dishes of delight,

(Such delights can never eloy)

To renew the appetite,

And to new-revive your joy.

ί Muse not then, if here you see
In this various worke of mine,

1 Such a mixt variety,
Sorting with this hum'rous time ε

i Though the Sunne shine in our sphere,

Ι Cloud or Night invelop it,
But the Sunne shines ever here,

ἶ Darting forth pure rayes of wit.

Now the fruit I wish to gaine,
Is your profit for my paine.
