the state and style of Man. My thoughts were so
fitted to that age, as if that age were ever to bee
master of my thoughts. Ι measured everie one by
mine owne last, and mused how any one could bee
serious. Ι knew not what they meant by a deare
Summer, or an unseasonable Harvest. These were
the least and lightest of my cares: while I found
plentie, Ι dreamed little of others scarcitie.——How
easily might any one have deceived mee with sha-

pottage before his inheritance was never more foolish,
than I was in the estimate of my vanities. What a

For civility, Ι held it for such a rag of unbeseeming
gentrie, as Ι scorned to take acquaintance of it. I
had long before this, aspired to a pipe of rich smoake
with a tinder—box, and these gave light to my lighter
discourses. I held my pockets sufficiently stored‚ if
they could but bring mee off for mine ordinarie, and
after dinner purchase mee a stoole on the stage. Ι
