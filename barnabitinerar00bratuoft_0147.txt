¹ had cares enough besides hoording, so as Ι held it i
¹ fit to disburden myselfe of that, and resigne it over 2
to the worldling. A long winter night seemed but a l
Mdsummer mglzt's dremne, being merrily past in a Ι
catch of foure parts, a deep health to a light Mis· l
tresse and a knot of brave blades to make up the
consort. I could jeere him to his face whom I
needed most: Ten at hundred, Ι meane, and he
would not stick to pay mee in mine owne coyne. 1
might beg a courtesie at his hands, but to starve
for't never prevaile, for herein 1 found this instru-
ment of usurie and the Devill to be of one Societie,
and that they craved nothing of any one, save onely
securitie. A weake blast of light fame was a great
part of that portion I aimed at. And herein was my
madnesse! Ι held nothing so likely to make mee
knowne to the world, or admired in it, as to be
debaueh't, and to purchase a parasite’s praise by my

“The day seemed long wherein I did not enjoy
them (pleasures x) the night long wherein 1 thought
not of them. I knew what sinne it was to sollicit a
maid unto lightnesse3 or to be drunken with wine,
wherein was excesse, or to suffer mine heart to be
oppressed with surfetting and drunkennesse: yet for
all this, run I on still in mine evill wayes, and so
continued till my evil dayes came upon mee, which
fitted themselves for pleasures too, but of another
degree, and in an higher straine of vanitie. Alas,
poore decrepit age! what pleasure can the whole
world find for such a cripple? Thine eyes are too
dim to discerne beautie3 thy lame legs can find no
feet, to walke to the house of the strangs woman.
Thy May—flowers no sooner withered than thy May-
games ended. Uselesse yeares, hawthorne haires,
fruitlesse cares stick close to thee 3 all things else
