³ (saving onely these constant companions‚ the infirmi-
ἱ ties of age) have long since left thee.'’ H‘z's Plea-
sures.
“Free-bred were my studies, so as, lapwinglike,
with shell on head, I begun to write before my yeares
1 could well make mee an author. But hence my
ἑ teares! The subjects Ι made choyce of were of
’ 1ον6 ; to close with my fancie which was verie light.
ἶ Ι was proud in bearing the title of a writer, which, Ι
ε must confesse, together with the instancie of such as
either truly applauded mee, or¹ deluded mee, made
’ 11166 ambitious after the name of an author. And
1 what were those light poems Ι then penned, but
such as are now pensive odes to my dolorous soule,
ἶ grieving to peruse what my youth so dearely loved?
ἵ Ο how familiar was Ι with Parnassus, Helicon,
Hippocrene, and all the Muses! Meanetime, 1
seldome or never thought of that heavenly Olympus,
which crowns all vertuous labours with true happi-
nesse. It was the saying of an holy father ‘Those
studies which I once loved, now condemne mee,
those which Ι sometimes praised now disparage
mee!' Far more cause have I to say how those
labours which Ι once fancied now afflict mee, those
which sometimes delighted mee, now perplex mee.
Ι am many times in company where Ι heare some of
my youthfull verses repeated, and though I doe
neither owne them nor praise them, yet must Ι in Ι
another place answer for them, if hee, on whom I
depend, shall not in these teares which I shed,
drowne the memory of them. For, alas! how many
chaste eares have Ι offended, how many light eares
have Ι corrupted with those unhappie works which I
have published? What wanton measures have Ι
writ for the nonc't, to move a light curtezanv to
, hugge my conceit 3 and next her Venus and Adonis,
