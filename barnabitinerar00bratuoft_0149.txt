Ι cannot speake to my owne slianie‚) those Cardinall
Vertzces whereof Ι treated3 and which to the imita-
tion of others Ι commended, found ever the worst
example in myselfe. Which could not chuse but
redound to my great dishonour, to see mee the least
ohserver of that, which Ι commended to another.
Likewise those Theologicall Vertues, which in those
my diviner workes, Ι so highly honoured ; with those
Seven Beatitudes‚ the practice whereof Ι so much
pressed, where found they my imitation in them, to

confirme my admiration of them? Now tell mee, Α

was this all that might hee required of mee? Was
it sufficient for mee to commend to others what Ι
meant not to amend in myselfe? W as this the duty
of an author? Whether bee our lives to be showne
in our pens, or our pens in our lives? Truth is, for
one actim man we have ten contemplative ,· amongst
which none ever professed more, and expressed lesse
than myselfe.'' ᾗ lb.

My Hand subscribes, my Heart's for Heaven.
