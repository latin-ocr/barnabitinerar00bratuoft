This little volume has an engraved title by Mar-

} shal, representing in three- -quarter figures (miniature

ovals), Moses, David, Asaph, Heman, and AEthan.
Various instruments of music, as improving psalmody,
are hung against a pedestal upon each side of the
title, which is given in an oval tablet as “by R. B.
Esq.'' Beneath the title, in another small oval, is
a portrait subscribed Quanquam ὃ. This portrait
appears to have been intended for our author, when
advanced 1n years, and therefore re-engraved for the
present edition.

‘The authors observed in this paraphrasess' are
stated to be “Appollinarius, B. Arias Montanus,
Genebrard, Lorinus, Buchanan, Berseman, Ainsworth,
Snegedin, and M. Anton Flammin. '' It is divided
into five books, containing respectively, viz. 41, 31,

1 17, 17, and 44. and added at the end, from Apol-

linarius, with combat of David and Goliah5 making

j the total 151.

As this entire version is very little known, we shall

’ venture to give rather longer extracts than the sub-
2 ject might otherwise require, as a savourable specimen

Ι

of our author' s easy versification.
