Psal. 107. Confitemcni Domina.

The Lord is God, with thanks expresse,
His mercy is for ever : and

2 So let the Lord’s redeem'd confesse,
Redeem'd from their distressors hand.

3 Which guthred were out of the lands
From shining Bast, from shady &Vest‚
From where the frozen Pole-starre stands
From desert south seas sun-burnt brest.

4 They wandred in the &Vildernesse‚

And tooke a solitary way,
Where foot of man did seldom presse,
Nor found they city where to stay.

5 With hunger pin’d, with thirsting faint,
Their anguish’t soule was overcharg'd,

6 Then to the Lord they made complaint‚
Who them from their distresse enlarg'd.

7 He led them on, and brought them horne,
The readiest way, for them the best ;
That to a city they might come,

An habitation where to rest.

8 Let them before the Lord confesse
His tender mercies many a one,

To men his wondrous workes expresse,
That he for Adams sons hath done.

9 The thirsty soule he satiates,

The hungry soule with good sustaines,

10 That sits in darknesse, at the gates,
And shade of death in iron chaines.

11 Because against the words of God
They bent themselves rebelliously,
Despis'd his counsell, and withstood
The hand of him that is Most—Hie.

12 Thus humbled, for they did not well,

In griefe of heart he let them lie,
Where down they fell, but helplesse fell,
For refuge none, nor help was nie.

13 Distrest unto the Lord they cri'd,

Who set them free from their distresse z
