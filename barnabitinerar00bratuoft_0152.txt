14 From darknesse‚ from deaths shade unti'd,
And brake their bands of heavinesse.

15 Let them before the Lord confesse
His tender mercies many a one,

To men his wondrous workes expresse,
That he for Adams sons hath done.

16 For he the gates of brasse hath broke,
The gates of brasse against him bent3
And by his hands resistlesse stroke,
The iron barres in sunder rent.

17 Fooles for their faults afflicted are,

XVhose way hath made their will their law z

18 Their soule abhorres all kind of fare,

Neere to the gates of death they draW.
19 Distrest, unto the Lord they cry,

Who them from dying anguish saves ;
20 He heales them by his wordes supply,

And frees thern from corrupting graves.
21 Let them before the Lord confesse

His tender mercies many a one,

To men his wondrous workes expresse,

Which he for Adam's sons hath done.
22 Before him offrings let them lay,

Confessions of their thankfulnesse,

And sacrifice of praises pay,

His workes with shouts ofjoy expresse.
23 They that in ships goe downe to sea,

And marts in many waters keep z

24 What deeds the Lord hath showne thern, see

His workes of wonder in the deep.

25 The stormy wind his word bespake‚

That all the maine with mountaines fills:
The sea-wet starres their mantles shake,
The brinie downes are turn'd to hills.

26 As high as heaven the billowes mount3
Dis-mounted‚ deep as heu descend :
Their melting soule makes small account,
But feare of death, in death to end.

27 Thus bandi’d to and fro they reele,

And stagger like a drunken man :
