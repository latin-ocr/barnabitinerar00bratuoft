Ill may the Pilot rule the keele,
NVhere wiscdomes care so little can.
28 Distrest unto the Lord they crie,
who sets thern free from their distresse :
29 The storme he calmes with cleerer skie,
And sets their waves at quietnesse.
30 The combat ceast, the seamen glad
That winds and waves were parted friends :
He that of them the conduct had,
To their desircd haven them sends.
31 Let them before the Lord confesse
His tender mercies many a one,
To men his wondrous workes expresse,
That he for Adams sons hath done.
32 Assembled in the peoples throngs,
His worthy acts when they repeat,
With hymnes of prais-e, and thankfull songs,
Exalt him in the Elders seat :
33 Which turnes the flouds to desert sands,
To drinesse drawes the springing well :
34 With salt he sowes the fruitfull lands,
For their misdeeds that therein dwell.
35 Againe, he turnes the desert dry
To standing pooles with water fill’d :
35 And seats the hungry down thereby,
Where they to dwell a city build.
37 Their fields they sow‚ their vines they plant,
Which yeeld them fruits of faire encrease :
38 Their mynes of wealth no hlessings want,
Nor suffreth he their heards decrease.
39 On them made lesse, and low brought downe,
He makes restraint, and anguish prey :
40 On princes leaves contempt to frowne‚
In deserts lets them lose their way.
41 Yet raiseth hee the poore man's head,
And makes him peopled housholds keep,
From selfe-waste want, with plenty fed,
For number like a flocke of sheep.
42 Right-sighted eyes shall see this day,
The joy of all the righteous name,
