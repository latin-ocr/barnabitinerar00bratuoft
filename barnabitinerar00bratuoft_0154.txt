And all iniquity shall lay

Her hand upon her mouth for shame.
43 Who so is wise, will take in hand

These observations to record :

And they shall truly understand

The tender mercies of the Lord.

Psal. 133. Ecce quam bonum.
Canticum Graduum Davidzls.

Behold how good it is, how pleasing well,
That there dwell unity where brethren dwell :
2 The precious odour did not sweeter smell,
When on the head the holy oil that fell,
As downe the heard, downe Aaron's beard it went,
Perfum'd the border of his vestiment.
3 So fall the pearly gems from Hermon Hill,
On Sion Mountaines so the deaws distill ;

And eithers fields with rich embroidry fill,

Powdring their un-shorne lockes with various skill z z
For there the Lord's command the blessing bound, .

And Brethren’s love with life eternall crown'd.

Psal. 137. Super flumina Babyl.

Downe sate we by the rivers side
that waters Babel's wall :
To raise whose streames, a springing tide
of teares, our eyes let fall.
Remembring Sion in our vowes,
- our uselesse harps we hung
2 Up, on amidst the willow boughes,
as slightly tun'd as strung.
3 For they that led us captives there,
requir'd of us a song3
A Sion song (said) let us heare,
these moanes some mirth among :
4 O no ! nor harp we have, nor hand,
nor voice to straine, nor string‚
