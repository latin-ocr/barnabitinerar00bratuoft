Ι Our Sion—song, in Shinar-land‚
¹ soncr of the Lord to siner.
1 5 If, O J‘Srusalem, I set ὁ
² no more by thee than so ;
ξ Let my right hand her skin forget‚
my voice her song foregoe.
Ι 6 My tongue fast to my palate cling
and never tune employ,
If ought I doe but Salem sing,
the soveraigne of my joy.
7 Be mindfull, Lord, of Edom's sons,
who said on Salem's day,
Raze, raze, to her foundations,
with earth her levell lay.
8 Thou daughter, Babel, laidst us waste,
thy selfe shalt wasted be :
O happy Ξ that as done thou hast
to us shall doe to thee.
9 O happy ἕ that thy little ones,
from mother's breasts shall rash,
And (pitilesse) against the stones‚
Their braines in pieces dash.

 

Psal. 1 5 1.
Ex Additione Apolinarii.

1 Sam. cap. 17.

Of all my Brethren, Ι (the least)
my Harp and Song assai’d ;
And while my flocke was at their feast,
to feast their Master plai'd.
2 Such happinesse have Shepheards crew,
that know no further care :
How happy were they, if they knew
how happy men they are!
3 That common not where clamours dwell,
nor covet but their owne ;
Nor to their betters knowne too well,
dye to themselves unknowne.
