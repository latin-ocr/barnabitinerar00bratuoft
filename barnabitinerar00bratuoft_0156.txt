4 But 311, my shepherds fare, farewess,
farewell my flocke of sheep ;
My little flocke‚ who kept you well
must you no longer keep.
5 Yet harp and song, that §hepherd sings
to whom the muse is given,
May change 3 51131116, and sing of kings,
may sing the King of Heaven.
6 Say then, what angel came to 6311
Η63ν611’5 champion forth to fight,
Against Heaven⁷s foe, and in 1115 fall
-put all 1115 host to flight?
7 ἻΤ Α 111311 of Gath, an infidell,
with him at bandy-strokes,
Of all the host of Israel,
3 combatant provokes.
8 His 111111165 were vast, and ample nerv'd,
his weapons not a few :
His sword and shield, the saint he serv’d,
his idols serv'd sor shew.
9 My Brethren valiant were and strong,
but God had not decreed,
To them the glory should belong,
of this Heaven-sorted deed.
10 God gave me courage to confound
this crest-swolne Python’s power;
To batter downe, and bring to ground
this cloud-threat Babel Tower.
11 Full forty dayes this Behemoth came,
to our hearts griefs to heare,
Blaspheming God's Almighty name.
Like weaver’s 11631116, 1115 5116316.
12 ‘ff No speare brought Ι, 1101 bow, nor bill,
of armour use had none ε
To charge 3 sling Ι had some skill,
and thence discharge 3 stone.
13 Wherewith, if right 1115 murrion sit,
may I but 566 1115 face,
My thunder-handed bolt shall hit
the destin'd speeding place.
