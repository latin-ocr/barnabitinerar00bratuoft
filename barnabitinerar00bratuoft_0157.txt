 

14 Enrag'd, mine eldest brother cri’d‚
This fight com'st thou to see?
Avant‚ proud boy : I soon replfd,
Is here no cause sor mee?
15 More calm King Saul : My heart (holds) good
yeeres (doubts) too seur, in truth :
Gath flesh't in battels‚ mones, and blood,
a kin-man from his youth.
16 But Ι, What is he more than man ?
Let no man's heart (said) faile ;
Against six cubits and a span,
shall not Heaven’s arme prevaile ?
17 A lion and a beare surpriz'd‚
and slaine my right hand hath t
This Philistine uncircumcis'd‚
What is this man of Gath ?
18 Comes Gath to shed our bloud for spoile,
as wine-presse sheds the grape ἓ
Or doth his Ekron's hungry soile,
for Judah's cities gape ?
19 With him to deal doe I desire,
these Rephaims force to feele:
Although his hands were hands of tire, ἱ
or Gad's of burning steele.
20 The lion and the beare for might,
were much the better part :
But man to man is equall fight‚
the odds is in the heart.
21 Admit with sithe he mowe his beard,
with harrow rake his head :
His lance be like a maine—mast reaffd,
an iron racke his *bed !
22 Ι bring to field <and God before)
as many hands as he :
A better cause, and courage more,
and these are armes for me.
23 The iron he is wont to weare,
who blames me to refuse ?
As much perhaps as Ι can beare,
much more than he can use.
