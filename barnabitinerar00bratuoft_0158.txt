24 He comes to me with sword and shield,
with steel'd-head speare in hand :
Arm'd with his name, come I to field,
that armies can command.
25 ἺῙ Then he, thy dreame·beleeving boasts‚
old Jesse's beardlesse sonne z

Thine host, thine hosts, Lord God of Hosts,

accurs'd be all, as one t
26 What honour shall my combate gaine,
with Shepherd Rivall shar’d :
Of thee, when men shall say (though slaine)
yet this was he that dar'd.
27 The only man of all his host,
so often urg⁷d thereto :
What none durst doe, who durst doe most,
that undertooke to doe.
28 That dar’d with one, that did excell,
encounter hand to hand :
In which encounter though he fell,
he fell, where none durst stand.
29 Thy glory will be easie bought,
a deathlesse victorie,
With me fit match but to be thought,
though purchas't with to die.
30 Give me a man, my equall match,
where like proportion lies :
With flies men may not eagles catch,
and eagles catch no flies.
31 Ye reeds of Judah, raise high wind,
and trumpet lond of warre :
But we by proofe, asunder finde,
your sound and substance farre.
32* Why, race of leaves Ξ why, shades on wall,
why should your female feare,
Since fall ye must, refuse to fall
by great Pelesheth's speare?
33 By us to have been overcome,
what losse shall ye sustaine ?
Sometime to have been lost, to some
hath prov'd the looser's gaine.
