34 Yeeld us your Lords, and home returne‚
¹ possesse your daies in peace :
³ With sword incense, not fire to burne,
thy braves‚ Ben-Jesse‚ cease.
35 Five thousand shekels'weight of brasse‚
my coat of Maile out-weighes z
Six hundred iron shekels masse,
upon my speare-pile playes.
ἶ 36 Beneath this weight thou scarce canst stand,
‘ scarce this bare burthen beare ε
But much more heavie my right hand,
, dye, ere thou feele‚ for feare.
ἰ 37 Adde then my helm, sword‚ shield, and lance,
a second load, alone
Too bigge for thee but to advance‚
Erat, with thy feeble bone 2
38 Thou hast three brethren arm’d in field ;
were all your strength in one,
All foure could not one Anak yeeld‚
to combat me alone.
39 More blest hadst thou abode at home,
and serv'd thy father's slaves,
Than, wretch‚ with me to eope have come,
as to a dogge with staveS.
40 In seorne, my sword is stain'd with none
before my wroth be whet 2
Now scorne and angerjoyne in one,
what rage shall both beget?
41 Thy bowels, and white—marrow’d bones,
shall therefore wild beasts eat :
Thy braines beat out with bats and stones‚
shall be the vultures meat.
42 ἾῘ What help Ξ I had no reaching dart,
no tackling but a thong :
A sling my weapon ; but a heart
above all weapon, strong.
43 Thy railing challenge speakes thee base,
in termes blasphemous flung :
Nor suits it with a souldier's grace,
to be so rank of tongue.
