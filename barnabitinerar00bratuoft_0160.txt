44 A lion’s head (foole) can out-heard
an host of heartlesse hinds :
The greatest men (is often heard)
beare not the greatest mincis.
45 Thy helme and target trust thou not,
with those unwieldy thighes ε
The compleat-arm’d Rhinocerot,
looke where he falls, he lies.
46 Thine armour's load but laggs faint beart,
for fiight the more unfit ε
The bigger man thou art, thou art
the bigger marke to hit.
47 Thou hast not soule enough to cramme,
that Carrick's every chinke :
The hugest hulke that ever sxvamme,
a small sprung leake may sinke.
48 YVhen aire and water fall to myre,
the purest from to fall,
She soule of element5‚ the fire
is spher⁷d above them all.
49 No sparke of that ethereall flame,
inspir'd thine earth-borne birth :
As from the earth thy Chaos came,
thou hast a soule of earth.
50 As earth, thy mother groan’d in paine,
when she thy burthen gave :
Thy breath‚ between thy teeth constraine,
and groaning gnaw thy grave.
51 But most, to make thy quarrell good,
must grounded cause be given :
Thy vantage is but flesh and blond,
mine is the hand of heaven.
52 What fury forc⁷t thee on these pikes‚
forlorne attempt to give?

“At heaven who strikes‚ himselfe he strikes,

and hath not long to live.
53 Of five Ι chose one pibble round,
that levell flew as line ;
And in his fore-head sunke a wound ;
Thou hast it, Philistine Ξ
