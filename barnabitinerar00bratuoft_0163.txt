3 The present edition is an exact reprint of the first.

⁴ Licensed to John Haviland, June 7, 1638.
However, [the date of publication] supplies no

proof as to the time of the sournal being written.

The existence of several pieces was announced by our

author long before they were submitted to the public. ἓ

Ι And many circumstances unite to confirm the belief

ἑ that the Itinerary was the lapped and cradled bant· ¹

ling of years, scarcely, in his own opinion, pubescent, s

until himself might be believed past the age of such ,

waggery. It may be characterised as a seedling planted

Ι in the spring of youth3 nourished and pruned in the ³

¹ summer of his days 3 courted to blossom amid ever-

ἐ greens that circled his autumnal brow, and which ,

Ι formed the wreat'n of farne that adorned and cheered Ι

5 the winter of his age, and remains unfadedfig ¹

’ Some further remarks as to the chronology of the

J sournal will be found under the notice of the edition
of 1805.

ascribed, we believe, to Mr Southey, it is said : “ The best ι
serious piece of Latin in modern merre, is Sir Francis Kinaston’s ἰ
Ι Amores Twz'lz et Cressez'dae, a translation of the two first books of
Ι Chaucer's poem3 but it was reserved f01 famous ΒΑΒΝΑΒΥ to
