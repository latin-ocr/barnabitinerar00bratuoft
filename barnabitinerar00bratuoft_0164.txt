SUCH was the title fabricated for this entertaining
Itinerary on its first reappearance. Whether it was
the happy thought of the editor, or suggested by a not
less interested person, the publisher, who might con-
j ecture a title more popular was required than that of

3 a mere ‘Journal’ (however, in the forefront it was
. said ‘ Vz'atoris solatio—for the traveller’s solace')‚ it is

now immaterial to inquire3 but it may be observed
that in the social tours of our Author‚ although he
never travels any great distance without halting and
making some entry in his Journal to record a good
sign or a pleasing hosteSS, there are fewer reeords
of absolute inebriety than might be expected from his
convivial manners and general bibacity. There are
gradations in all vicious pursuits; and our Author

i labours to preserve the character of his hero in unison
ἶ with the common idiom of the period when he wrote,
’ by never representing him otherwise than ‘maudlin
ἶ drunk.' It might happen, and probably was so, that
ι the term ‘Drzmken Barnaby,' being the burthen of an

old ballad‚ was sufficiently popular to cause this

alteration of title, which is only worth noticing, to

ς prove that an ill name lasts for ever, and to remark

Α that our hero Barnabee is so universally known as a

Drunkard, and so very little known as a Journalist‚
that a reader may expect on beholding the original
title he is going to be introduced to a stranger instead
of a very old acquaintance.

The merit of this edition may be easily appreciated
by considering the omissions‚ variations‚ and additions.
