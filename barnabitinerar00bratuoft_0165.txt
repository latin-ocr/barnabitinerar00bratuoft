And from examining these points it seems impossible

to doubt as fact, that the editor did not possess a

perfect copy of the first edition, to which circumstance ,
may be attributed similar omissions in some of the ς

later editions. But to the analysis:

OM1ss1oNs. The titles before each of the four ’

parts* The lines* Ad Translatorem and To the
Translator. The lines* Ad Philoxenum and To
PliiloxenuS‚ p. 430—1. Prose address to Reader, and
Errata.⁹⁶

VARIATIONS. The frontispiece reversed from right
to left, on the label from the pipe ‘ sic transit,' &03
on that from the roll of tobacco upon the table ‘fumus
et umbra sumus.·⁷ the parcel bound across with a
string has in the four divisions ‘ Ede-Bibe-Sta-Lzzde;'
the empty pot is left without inscription, and the

 

label at the top of the plate has only ζΒανηαύαῑ 3

Jtinerarz‘um.'
The text was modernized throughout, and in many
instances altered, though not always improved.†
ADDITIONS. As an embellishment there was in-
troduced a print of our hero taking leave of his host
at the Inn door, at the sign of the Be11,‡ by having a
stirrup glass; the hostess is just seen behind the

t Landlord 3 and the hostler attends the act of mount-

ing on the off side of the horse. The Index was
added, and the following introductory matter, also
repeated in the Subsequent editions.

’κ’ The titles and lines at p. 7 and the other asterisks also ⁹

ξ omitted in later editions.

† The same liberty was taken with the next three editions.

The respective collations are preserved in another part of the .

present volume.
‡ Probably at Stone.
