χ “THE PREFACE To THE READER. Ι
ι

l “ It will not, Ι hope, be thought unnecessary‚ if I Ι
ἱ lay before the reader my reason for republishing this

ᾗ facetious little book, after a delitescency of near a ἰ
ξ hundred years. Being desir’d by a gentlewoman to i
' look over a parcel of old bookS, among ’em Ι chanc'd ξ
l upon Drunken Barnaby, which reading gave me satis· Ι
faction for my trouble 3 whereupon Ι took a resolution ’ἰ
, to publish it, that others might therewith be pleas’d ε
ζ as well as myself. What Ι can gather of the author?
l is chiefly from himself, for he says, coming to a place ξ
2 call'd Harrington, he was well pleas'd with the omen, 1
and spent some money there for name sake, so that l
Ι conclude his name was Barnaby Harrington. He ξ
further sayS, that after a tedious journey of about six 1
1 miles a day, and sometimes three or four, (very weary, Ι
and heavy laden,) he at last arriv'd at Apulby in West- ξ
ἐ moreland, where he was born 3 and where, if Ι mistake i
³ not, there are some remains of the family still living.

s That he was a graduate in Queen's College‚ Oxon, is
plain, but I have not had an opportunity of knowing
what degrees he took. ’Tis the man no doubt, of ζ
whom the song says, '

Hey, Barnaby Ξ take't for a warning, δίε.

ὲ He sayS‚ he afterwards (after four journeys backward ἶ

* and forward) married in the country, turn’d farmer,
and frequented the horse—fairs all round the country, =

³ buying horses when cheap, and (like a true jockey) Σ

, selling 'ern when dear, upon which he is very pleasant. ·
I thought fit to say thus much, and more Ι have not,

¹ only wished the Reader pleas'd as I was.''
