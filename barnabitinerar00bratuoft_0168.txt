sist of four prints, ‘J. Clark, sculp.' from subjects
illustrative of each Journey3 viz. I. The Puritan
gibbeting the cat, vol. ii. p. 23. Π. Barnaby carried

The voyage on the haycock from Wansforth briggs,
p. 239. IV. Examining the horse without a tail‚

tute that of a female only, thereby exhibiting the
subject of the ballad without re-engraving the whole
plate.
