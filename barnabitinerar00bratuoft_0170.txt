The principal merit of this edition consists in the
prefixing of an Advertisement‚ which collects much

conjectural and other amusing matter relative to the ζ

supposed author and his Journal.

“ ADVERTISEMENT.

“ A NEW edition of Drunken Barnaby's Journal, in
Latin and English rhime, having been long a de-
sideratum in the literary world, the Publisher thought
it would be deserving well of such as had a taste
for wit and learning, to extend the acquaintance of a
festive bard, who has delighted all to whom he has
been know n.

‘⁶ A Frenchman has written a volume, concerning
authors who had published works under fictitious
names. The facetious author of ‘Travels to the
North, four times backward and forward,' might
perhaps be enrolled in the number; for there is
reason to believe Barnaby Harrington to be a de-
nomination void and vain.

‘² Various motives, good and bad, induce authors to
conceal themselves from the public. Out of a capri-
cious haughtiness, Swift rarely avowed any of his pro—
ductions: and Voltaire‚ from regard to his personal
repose, disavowed many of his, with an earnestness
not very consistent with the principles of truth, But
the motives to concealment, whatever they may be,
have force only for a time 3 the· pride and fascination
of authorship usually prevail in the end with every at-
tractive writer to lay claim to the laurels of literature.
This, however is not invariably the case; whether
from fortuitous circumstances, or peculiarity of dis-

position, there are several celebrated productioris of j
l which the authors remain inscrutable to curiosity 1
