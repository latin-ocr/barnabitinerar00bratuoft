’ Barnaby's descriptions 3 probably a large share.
, Having invested himself with a poetical character, it
may be presumed that he both fabricated and
j adapted incidents to suit it, like other dealers in
= poetry. A song, such as the perusa] of his travels
might suggest, was composed, and is cited by one of
his editors3 but as only a single couplet of it has

Be no more drunk nor dry in a morning.' -ς-

Qui ditarunt Middletommz. [Vol. II. p. 202.] Ι

Esq , whose stores of varied and extensive information are ⁸
