the word Harrz'ngton, a name of still baser coinage.
Both these are the wilful misconception of the editor
of the second edition. Can the stanza upon the town
of Harrington, which is the sole authority for that
, designation, by any enlarged meaning be construed
χ to imply more from the equivoque, than that our
s rambling humourist simply gave the beggar at Harring-
j ton a Ham'z'ngton or town token? The real author
1 says, on another occasion, “coine for stampe sake
Ἰ we allowe,'' alluding, undoubtedly, to such local
ἕ tokens being in common circulationfae' As such, this
reputed name, certainly adopted from the need of a
better, may be dropt just as it was taken up, without
l either care or consequence.
That the birthplace of the author was Appleby is
l doubtful, though the distance therefrom was not so
ὲ great as to make its assignation exceed the limits of
3 the licentia poetica. The marriage, final settlement,
’ and some other incidents appear true events in the

1 College, which must have been conjectured in conse-
1 quence of the record of the horn of that college
’ speaking “ pure Athenian.''
