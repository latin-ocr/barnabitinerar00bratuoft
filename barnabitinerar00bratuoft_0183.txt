flourished under the reigns of James Ι. and Charles 2
L, and also a moral writer and satirical poet of emi- ῗ
nence ?——Such a portrait may be easily drawn from ¹
the lise, character, and writings of chHARD BRATH- ,
WAIT.

That writer flourished above fifty years 3 and how· ’
ever difficult it may often be to trace an anonymous
work to its parent source, yet a voluminous author,
of only partial celebrity, can seldom so thoroughly
disguise his style as not to be discovered. With him,
as with an artist, repeated labour creates the mannerist 3
and the common use os a set phrase forms, like the
mistresses of Rubens‚ the gray horse of Wouvermans,
the boors tippling of Teniers, or the animals of Snyders, [
direct evidence for appropriation. One of the strong .'
peculiarities of Brathwait, of this description, is found ,
in the first edition of the Itinerary. There four pages
have for a running title “Upon the Errata's;'' now
what author of that period, except Bratliwait, deviates
from the custom of collecting all as “Errata,'' and
indulges, like him, in a serious or humorous apology
for the mistakes of the press under this fixed title? i
But Brallcwait's apologies contain further proof, as for ,
example— ;

“ Upon the Errata. Gentlemen (humanum est ,
errare) to confirme which, &o—knoxv iudicious dis· 3
1 posed Gentlemen, that the z'ntricacz'e of tlte capte, and ζ

tlze absence (ff tlte antlwr from many important proofes, 3
were occasion of these errors‚’' ᾗ &o ¹

“Upon the Errata⁷s.-Tlce Authors absence, with ι
tlzez'ntrz‘cacie <ff tlzz's copie, caused these Escapes here ξ
committed, to be so many. But no wonder, if subjects ι
of this nature become subject to Error, when they treat l
of so giddie an humour, as Liquor and Vapour.
