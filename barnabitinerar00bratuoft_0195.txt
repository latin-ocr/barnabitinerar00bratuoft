In an engraved title there is an interesting display
of the principal subjects discussed in the two works‚
after the manner but not precisely copied from the
titles to the earlier editions. The figures are nearly
ζ all changed, the rnottoes omitted, and much of the ξ

garniture altered. Whetlier this deviation froin the l
3 original designs obtained the sanction of the author l
seems doubtful, unless he was too indolent to revise ¹
the broadside‚ containing an explanation of the
frontispiece‚ as the two sheets of the first edition are
here printed together without alteration. The title
has ‘W. Marshall sculpsit,' and is a valuable speci-
men of the correct taste and execution of that en-
graver.

The second leaf of the volume is a distinct title to
