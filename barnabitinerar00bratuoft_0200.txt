As early as 1614 our author dedicated Τίτε Ρνοτῖῑξαίς
Teares to Richard Hutton, Sergeant at Law‚† with
whom he appears to have been intimate, and probably
they were distantly related.

Some dedicatory lines are inscribed “to my truly-
esteemed and highly-respected Cosin Thomas Hutton
l Esquire3 3 member of the Honourable Society of
Grais-Inne.'' Another poem entitled “Astraeas
’ Shrine,’' and “Upon this poem,’' are followed by ³
an address

“To my worthily-accomplished and most en-
deared Cosiri, Sir Richard Hutton Knight.

Sir, here receive these Obit-teares of ours,
While Native love and duty nourish yours :
Let us then joyne our Funerall odes in one,
His dearest Gall-senne with his Eldest Sonne.

, *yA frontispiece with all the strength and spirit of Marshall,
i has a strong likeness and whole-length figure of the Judge in his
ζ robes, in a reclining posture3 a hand from the clouds with a
labe] “ Farewell‚ Honest Judge.’' Other inscriptions—“ Vale
1 pauperis optime praeses‚'' ‘⁶ Vale debilis alme Satelles.’' It is an
ὲ excellent portrait of the judge, and of the greatest rarity‚ not
1 being noticed by Graiuger.
