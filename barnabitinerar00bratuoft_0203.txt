The poem begins at the back 011116 title—-

Remove that 1111161311- -pile3 now six whole 163165
Ι-13ν6 beene the nursing 1110111615 01 my te 1165.

These rivell’ d furrows 01 1111116 aged clieel e

Have w rit griefes characters exceeding deepe

But what’ 5 perpetuall cannot mix with earth,

]01 65 rnust partake 111111 163165 and teares with mirth.
’111056 631616556 folding 5 01 1111116 3111165 1111151 66356
While 31 165 resounded cares, and cares 311- -111665;
While tones were threnes‚ ech motion of my tongue <⁷
The dying accent 013 5111311- -like song.

These must be closed in her sacred 51111116

whose living beautie, 11111116 611511116(1 1111116,

Made me too 63111111· blest 3—Another rite

Must banish these presentments from my sight.

⁴ He then describes the necessity of foregoing funeral

cessity in that respect is interestingly described. Of
himself he says—

Now some will aske why my decaying time
Should to such solemne nuptiali rites incline?
Whereto I answer, no licentious fire

Inflam’d my sprinkling organs with desire,

No glowing 11631 01 fancy did I 16616,

Unto my ε : : : : I 1166111 111311 appeale.

These were unfitting motives to weake sense,
Though age must render age benevolence
When time, place, spirit may such acts admit
With equall willing minds to second it.

No, my affection never tooke delight

I th' light embraces osa marriage night,

Nor to make sacred rights such tempting lures
To sate th' desire without more inward cures.
For had these bene mine ends, my constant ayme
Had long since fixt upon more youthfull game.
