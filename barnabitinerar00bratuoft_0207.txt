Dedication: “To Sir J. P. Baronet. Sir, Ι send
you heere an Assize Booke, or rather a Treatise of
Poysons3 to peruse which, 1 had not given you the
trouble, had not your own commands obliged mee to
it: for what my memory faild me of in our last dis·
eourse upon this subject of Heretikes, 1 have, to

ἑ comply with your desires, turn’d over those few

 

 

l

Treasuries of Commota places wherewith my reading
hath furnished mee. And now you may behold the

Locusts creeping out of the bottomlesse Pit in their ι

orders, and heare all their severall tones,’' ἃς.

The Muster Roll of “Capitall Heretikes in the
severall Centuries,” commences with No. “I. Simon

Magus, An. Dom. 55. or thereabouts,'’ and terminates

with No. “ L. The new Arrians, Ann. 1534, or there- ²

abouts.’' At the end the following

“Postscript.—And now, Sir, I could wish that
these Heretikes survived only in Paper, but alas

they are all lived over againe, though they seeme i

l

not at this resussitation to have so bright ascendants
as at their birth, for then many approved Wits, and
persons of reverend name, were given over to believe
these lies now few besides narrow indigested souls
run after them: a providence that promises they will
the sooner find their graves, for the vulgar are still as
covetous of novelty, as of your commands is
“ Sir,
“Your most humble Servant
‘⁴ R. B.”
