¹ At p. 115 commences another portion of the
· volume, and the most curious. The prefatory lines
l are entitled “ His Vision ;'² wherein having communed
l with certain Apes, we have next'The Apes of Honour,
Ι Pleasure, Vaine-glory‚ Fancy, Fashion‚ Observation:
ἰ with Court‚ city, Country‚ Church, Judiciall, Politicall,

Critick5 Apes Censure: with “The Life of Poly-
morphus Simianus Author of this Poem,” and “The
Draught or Portrait of every Ape, with their distinct
properties‚ &c.⁷'—These biting satires show a long
and well-studied knowledge of mankind, and are
given with the same strong cast of character which

The stones of lVlzilby-strand, that snakie wonder?
Bruertons Logg which on a mote doth lye,

And sinking hodes the Amastor must dye.

Or of Saz'nt Quintius (as l⁷ve heard it told)

Whose ancient seat is Harpham in the would ;
