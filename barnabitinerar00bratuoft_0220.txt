[Not printed in the Author's lifetime ς at least no i
edition has been found. lt was included in slsis-
* cellanea Antiqua Angliccmcz, where it forms No. 83
and a coeval MS„ supposed to be the one from 1
which the text was taken, is in the British Museum]

 

ff In forming the foregoing> Catalogue Ι have
' derived much valuable assistance from the collections
Α of Mr Heber, ΜΓ Freeling, Mr Perry, and Mr Hibbert‚
l and from the Bodleian Library through the Rev. P.
Bliss 3 and it will be found to add considerably to the

years 1636 to 1640 remain undiscovered They were
¹ probably appended to Elegies on distinguished
characters then recently deceased. Their annual con· ,
tinuance after 1641 may be doubted . it was a subject '
unlikely to assimilate with the feelings of the second
3 wife and bruit of common observation.
