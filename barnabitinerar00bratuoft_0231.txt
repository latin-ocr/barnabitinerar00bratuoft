THis three dayes taske was once imposed me,
In the first Spring of my minoritie3

No edge of Razer then had toucht my chin,

Nor downy shade approach'd my supple Skin 3

Ι knew not th' postures of this Indiam vapor,

Nor made my Sacrifice unto my Taper ;

I'd ne’re §eene any Curiatiae nor partz‘tz'ozz,

Which beget worke for Surgeon and Physicia72;

Ι was a Novice in the Schoole of Sin,

Nor yet did ‘casm what others dived in.

Excuse this Subject then, if’t doe not fit

The nicenesse of this Age for weight and wit.

Birds flieker first before they learne to fly,

And trust me on my credit so did Ι.

“’ Great Tasks when they'r to shorter times confin'd

‘⁴ Will force a Worke mount lower than the mind.'⁷
