E nglz‘slc and Latine:

His Northerne Journey:
First Part.

MIRTILUS δε FAUSTULUS

inter-speakers,
ἷζᾟΡΙῑΗΤΠΑ.
ῖς FA‚USTULUS stretch thy hand out
’ Take thy Liquor, doe not stand out:
Ῐκῇ ⁷ ἐξ Art thou prest with griping dolour. ³
Let the grape give thee her colour
Bread' S a binder, wealth⁷ s a miser,
Drinke down care, and thou art wiser.

   

O Faustulus, tell thy true hart,

In what Region, Coast‚ or New part,
F ield or Fold thou hast beene bousing,
Without linnen, bedding, housing,

In what Taverne, pray thee show us,
Here on Earth, or else below us?
