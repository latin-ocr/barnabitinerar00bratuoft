In my progresse travelling Northward,
Taking my farewell oth' Soutlnvard,
To Banbety carne Ι, Ο prophane 01161
Where Ι saw a Puritane-one,
Hanging of his Cat on Monday,

For killing of a Mouse on Sonday.

To Oxford came Ι, whose Copesmato

Is Minerva, Well of Plato ,-

From which Seat doe streame most seemlie,
Aganippe, ffijpocrenoe

Each thing ther’s the slsuses stlinz'mz,

cheenes Collega-Hom speakes pure Athenian.

Thence to Gedslo, with my Lovers,

Where a Tombe a Strumpet covers 3
RosAMUND lies there interred‚

Flesh 10 (11151 and shade's compared,
Lye he ’bove‚ or lye she under,

To be buried is no wonder.
