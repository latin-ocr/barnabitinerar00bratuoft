Barnabas Jozffnczll.

First part.

Thence to lVeodstocle Ι resorted‚

Where a Labyrinth's reported,

But of that no ’count I tender,

I found an Hostesse quicke and slender:
And her Guests more sweetly eying,
Than a thousand Rosammzds dying.

From thence to Bracklejm as did beseeme one,
The May'r Ι saw, a wondrous meane one,
Sstdng, thatching and bestowing

On a Wind-blowne house a strowing‚

On me‚ eald he, and did charme mee,

‘⁵ Drinke lesse, eat more, Ι doe warne thee‘

Thence to Daz‘ntree with my sewell,
Famous for a sVoble Duell,

Where Ι drunk and took my Common
In a Taphouse with my &Vomang
While Ι had it, there Ι paid it,

Till long clzalking broke my credit.

Thence I came to th’ Bell at Lakter,
Where my braines did need a plaister;
First night that Ι was admitted, Α
By the Watchmen Ι was whipped,
Black and blew like any tetter

Beat Ι was to make me better.
