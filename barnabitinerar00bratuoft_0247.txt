F irst part.

Thence to Gottam, where sure am L
Though not all fooles I saw many3
Here a She-gun found I prancing,
And in Moon-shine nimbly (lancing,
There another wanton madling

Who her Hog was set a sadling.

Thence to ⁹⁶Nott2’ngam‚ where tovers,
High-way riders, Slzerwood drovers,

Like old Robin-Hood, and semler,

Or like Lz'ttlesolm his varlet 3

Here and there they shew them doughty,
Cells and XVoods to get their booty.

⁹⁶ Brave Illortimer’s now dead, his glory dust‚

His Courts are clad with grasse, his Han with rust.
His stan-es steepe steps, his Horse-troughs cisterns are,
Wormes his embraces, kisses ashes share.

Time cryeS‚ I eat, and Eceo answers it ;
But gone, e're to returne‚ is held unfit.

O Heroes of these Heroes take a view,

They'r to their fathers gone, and so must you t
Os better clay you are not than these men,
And they are dead, and you must follow them.
