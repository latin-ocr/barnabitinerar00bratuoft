first part.

Thence to Asclstfhld, where Ι knew one,
That was comely and a trew one,

With her a nak’d compact made Ι,

Her long lov'd Ι, with her laid Ι,

Towne and her Ι left, being doubtfull
Lest my love had made her fruitfull.

Thence to ⁹⁵Ove7‘b0wles, where “²³Da7ms
Dwelt with's Danes in time offanum
Way to th' Towne is well disposed,
All about with trenches closed,

Pallisado’s hid with bushes,
Rampires overgrowne with rushes.

On a Feast day came Ι thether,
When good people flockt together,
Where induc’d by their exemple',

Ι repair'd unto the Temple 3

Where Ι heard the Preacher gravely‘
With his Nose pot-tipt most bravely.

 

÷÷ In Janus time was Dauus seated here,
As by their pales and trenches may appeare.
