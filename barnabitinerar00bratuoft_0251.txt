First part.

Dormise-Iike the people seemed,

Though he eride, they sleeping dreamed3
For his life, tho there was harme in't‚
Heart was lesse rent than his garment3
With his feet he did so thunder

As the “’ pulpit fell asunder.

Which occasion having gotten,

All ‘tarvakffi the pulpit broken3

While the Preacher lay sore wounded,
With more boords than beards surrounded‚
All to dfflner, who might mter,

And among them I left Pastor.

Thence to Clowne carne I the quicker,
Where I'de given my skin for liquer,
N one was there to entertaine us

But a Nogging of Vulcanus,
Who afford't me welcome plenty,
Tin my §earne-rent purse grew empty.

ἦ The fragments of which pulpit they were pleas’t
To sacrifice to th’ ashes of their Feast. L t
uere .

† Pray you, good Townsmen, sacred Springs affect,
Let not your Preacher read, and you neglect.
