Thence to th’ Ball at Rollzram came Ι,
Where my gold, ifI had any,

Lert I. long Ι stoutly rored

Till oth' Bridge I broke my forehead‚
Whence ashamed while brows smarted‚
I by Night-time thence departed.

Thence to Demostcr, who'l beleeve it !
Both a ngrlet-oue and a chs'te

There Ι viewed3 too too aged,

Yet to love so farre engaged,

As on Earth she only wished

To be painted, pricked‚ kissed.

Thence to *Abcrsorass whose beginning
Came from buying drink with pinning3
Poor they are and very needy,

Yet of liquor too too greedy3

Have they never so much plenty,
Belly makes their purges empty.

 

÷÷ At such time as we s‹›j‹›urn'd in this poor village, it chanced
that a certaine Pinner, and one of the choicest os all his Flocke,
being choakcd with pin-(lust, dyed : To whose Memory wee
sind this Epitaph indm-sed.

ὃ cruell Death

To rob this man ofbreath‚

Who whil’st he liv'd in scraping of a pin,
Made better dust‚ than thou hast made os him.
