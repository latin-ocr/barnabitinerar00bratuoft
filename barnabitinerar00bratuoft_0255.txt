Bamczbee’s Jommzll.
Fl'rst part.

Thence to W’etherbe, where an apt one
To be Twcake unto a Captaine

Ι embraced, as Ι gat it,

Door creek’d, Captain tooke me at it,
Took me and by th’ Eares he drew me,
And headlong down staires he threw me*

Turning thence, none could me hinder
To salute the lmkffield pinder,-

Who indeed's the worlds glory‚

With his Cumrades never sory.

This the cause was, lest you misse it,
Georgies Club I meant to visit.

Streight at lVakeseeld was Ι seene a,
Where I sought for George a Greene a,
But Ι could find no such creature,

On a Signe I saw his feature :

Where the strength of ale so stirr'd me,
I grew stouter farre than Geordz'e.

A wench more wanton than Kate Arden
Sojourns‚ one that scorns a Wast-coat,
WVooing Clients with her basket.
