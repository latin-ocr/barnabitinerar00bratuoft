 

Bamzczbees Jozthczll.

Fc'rsl part.

Thence to Bradfiwd, my tongue blisters
At the family of sidem,

They love, are lov’d to no Eye-show‚
They increase and multiply τοο,
Furnish’d with their spritely weapons
She-flesh feeles Clarks are no Capons.

Thence to Klghlqv, where are mountaines
Steepy-threatning‚ lively fountaines‚
Rising Hils, and bnrraine vasseis,

Yet Bon—Secz‘o's and good fellowes,
JoviaH—jocund—jossy Bowlers,

As they were the world Controulers.

Thence to Gcggleswz'ck most sterill,
Hemm’d with rocks and shelves of perssl 3
N eare to th' way as Traveller goeth,

A fresh ἦ Spring both Ebbes and Floweth‚
Neither know the Learnd'st that travell
What procures it, salt or szvell.

ἦ Neare th’ bottorn of this Hill, close by the way

A fresh Spring Ebs and Flowes ass houres oth’day.
