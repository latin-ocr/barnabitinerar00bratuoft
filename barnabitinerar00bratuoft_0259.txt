Bamzczbees Jonmzczll.
Fz‘rsl part.

Thence to Claplcam, drawing nyer
He that was the common Cryer,
ff To a breakefast of one Herring
Did invite me first appearing.
Herring he, Ι drinke bestowed,
Pledges of the love we owed.

Thence to [nglelom where Ι dwelled

Till I brake a Blacksmiths palled,
Which done, women rush'd in on me,
Stones like haile showr’d down upon me,
W hence amated, fearing harming,

Leave Ι tooke‚ but gave no warning.

Thence to Lenesdale‚ where I viewed

An Hall which like a Taverne shewed 3

N eate GateS, white Walls, nought was sparing„
Pots brim-full, no thought of caring:

They eat, drink‚ laugh, are still mirth-making‚
Nought they See that's worth care taking.

The poore mans box is in the Temple set,
Temple on Hill, th’Hill is by waters bet.
