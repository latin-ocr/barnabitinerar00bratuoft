Bamzczbees Joltmzczll.
first pasl.

Thence to Cowbrow, truth Ple tell ye,
Mine hostesse had a supple belhe,

Bodie plumpe, and count'nance cheerfull‚
Reeling pace (a welcome fearfull)

Like a drunken Hag she sturnbled‚

Till she on her buttocks tumbled.

Thence to Abdand, being come thither,
He who Yorks Contempts did gather
Gave me harbour, light as fether

We both drunke and eat together,

Till halfe-typsy‚ as it chanced‚

We about the Alsaypole danced.

Thence to bikland, thence to Kendall,

I did that which nien call Spendall,

Night and day with Sociats many

Drunk Ι ale both thick and clammy.

“ Shroud thy head, Boy, stretch thy hand too.
“ Hand h'as done, head cannot stand to.

Leaving these, to Staveley carne Ι,
W here now all night drinking am Ι,
Alwayes frolick, free from yeHOWS,
With a Consort of good feHows,
Where I'le stay and end my journay,
Till Brave Barnabe returne-a.

FINIS.
