Second part.
FAUSTUL.
Γῑῇ Hat Ι was once, same Ι am now,
WRAE' Haste, conditions‚ garments same too,
 } ¹· * Yea, there's no man justly doubteth‚
’ These the same shooes Ι went out with ς
And for combe Ι ne're us'd any,
Lest Ι lost some of my stlemy.

     

But attend me, and partake it,

What Ι loved, what Ι hated‚

ἦ Βτίἀςεε, fountaines‚ nmuntaines, Valleis‚
Cauls, cells, hillocks‚ high-wayeS, shallows,
Paths‚ towns, villages, and trenches,
Chast-choice-chary-merry wenches.

Truth I'le tell thee, nothing surer,
Richer am Ι not, nor poorer,
Gladder, madder, nor more pleasing,
Blsther, brisker‚ more in season,
Better‚ worser, ffiinner, thicker,
Neither healthsuller nor sicker.

 

³⁵ England amongst all Nations, is most-full
Of hius, wells, bridges, churches‚ women, wooll.
