Second part.

For the world Ι so farre prize it,
But for Liquor I’d despise it,
Thousand deaths I’d rather dye too,
Than hold Ale mine Enemy tho:

“Sober‚ Lamb-like doe Ι wander,
“ Drunk‚ I'm stout as Alexander.

When my head feeles his Maeander,

Ι am stronger than Lysander ,-

Th’Ile of Ree Ι little feare it

Without wound to winne and weare it 3
But lest tedious Ι expresse me,

To my Pregresse I'le addresse me.

F irst place where Ι first was knowne-a‚
WVas brave solen a Gants* old Towne-a‚
A Seat antiently renowned,

But with store of Beggars drowned:
For asaylor ripe and mellow‚

The world h'as not such a fellow.

³⁶ An ancient Arch doth threaten a decline,
And so must strongest Psses give way to time.
