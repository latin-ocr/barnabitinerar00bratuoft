Bamzabees Journczll.

Second part.

Thence to Aslclen, good as may be

Was the wine, brave Knight‚ bright Ladie‚
All Ι saw was cornely speciou8‚

Seemly gratious, neatly precious 3

My Muse with Bacchus so long traded‚
When Ι walk't, my legs denaid it.

Thence to Garesstzng, pray you barke it,
Ent'ring there a great Beast-market‚

As I jogged on the street-a

'Twas my fortune for to meet-a

A young Heyfer, who before her

Tooke me up and threw me o're her.

Thence to preston, Ι was led-a,

To brave Bam'sters to bed-a,

As two borne and 'bred together

We were presently sworne brether 3
Seven dayes were me there assigned,
Oft I supt, but never dined.

Thence to Ezzxstmz, where mine Hostesse
Feeles as soft as any tost is,

Jucy, lusty, counffnance toothsome‚
Braided haire, but breath most loathsome l:
Her Ι left with locks of amber,

Phyllis light me to my chamber.
