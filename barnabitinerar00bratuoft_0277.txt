Second part.

Thence to Wzggzbz about supper,
To an Hostesse‚ none more slutter,
Buxome was she yet to see to,
She'd be drunk for companie too3
Wit this Beldam soon did scater,

And in Bed distill’d her water.

Thence to Newton in the willam,
Where being boulstred up with pillows,
Ι at Cards plaid with a girle

*Rose by name, a dainty pearle‚

At Cent-foot I often moved

Her to love me whom I loved.

Thence to l‘Varrington, banks or'eflowed‚
Travellers to th' Towne were rowed‚
Where supposing it much better

To be drown'd on Land than XVaten
Sweetly, neatly I sojourned

Till that deluge thence returned.

’ἕ Fresh was my Rose, till by a A'ortlzw‘ind tost‚
She sap, sent, verdure, and her vigour lost.
