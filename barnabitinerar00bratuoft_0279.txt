Bamczbees Jozmzall.

Second part.

Thence to Cock at Bada-malz, where Ι
Drunk strong ale as browne as berry,
Tin at last with deep-healths feHed,
To my bed Ι was compelled3

Ι for state was bravely sorted‚

By two Poulterers supported.

Where no sooner understand Ι

Of mine honest Hoast Tem. Gandi,
To Holme Chappell forthwith set Ι,
Maid and Hostesse both were prety‚
But to drinke tooke Ι affection,

Ι forgot soone their complexion.

Thence to T aulee-a-ffi'll resort Ι,

An hill steepy‚ shppery, durty3

Smith with me being well acquainted
Drunk with me till ’s wits were tainted‚
Having left me, Venus swore it,

She’d shooe-horn her Vulcans forehead.

At lew-Castle under line-cz,

There Ι troune’d it in burn’t wine-a 3
None oth’ Wz‘cked there remained,
Weekly Lectures were proclaimed :
Chastity they roughly handle,

When blind zeale snuffs out the candle.
