 

Earnabees Journall.

Second part.

Thence to th'Bell at Stene streight draw Ι,
*Delia no Diana saw I 3

By the Parson 1 was cited

Who held me for Jesuited 3

In his search, the door fast locked‚
Nought but Cards were in my pocket.

Thence to Haywood taking ssight-a,

The Hostesse gave rne brawne at night-213
But what's that unto the matter?
Whiskins sorted with my nature ε

To brave Bacchus no gift quicker

Than oblatione of strong liquor.

Thence to Rz‘dgelay, where a Black-smith,
Liquor being all hee'd take with,

Boused with me 3 mid-night waking

And a looking-glasse there taking,
Chamber-pot was h01⁷d quite th0r0w‚
Which made me lye wet till morrow.

ἦ ὂ my honey-suckle Delia Ι
