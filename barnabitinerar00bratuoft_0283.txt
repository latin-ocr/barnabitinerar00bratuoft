 

Bammbees Jonmzall.

Second part.

Thence to Eranam, old Claudm
Did approve us and appland us,
Where Ι heard a wofull bleating,
A curst wife her husband beating;
Neighbour rode sor this default-a‚
While Ι dyde my front with malt-a.

Thence to ⁹⁶ Lz'clzfield went Ι right on,
W here Ι chanced to invite one,

A Curmudgeon rich but nasty,

To a supper of a pasty.

Having sipt‚ and sunt, and ended,
What Ι spent, the Miser lended.

Thence to Celesill‚ to a Shamble
Like an old Fox did I amble‚

To a cellar, troth I'le tell ye,
Fusty‚ musty, headlong fell 13
But the Butcher having made-a
Th'fire his bed, no more Ι staid-a.

 

 

÷÷ Incios’d with clffss, trees, Scienes‚ Artichokes,
The fruitfull vale up to thy Temple lookes.
