Second part.

Thence at Meredin appeare Ι,

Where growne surfoot and sore weary,
Ι repos'd‚ where Ι chuckt Jone-a‚

Felt her pulse, would further gone-a3
There we drunk, and no guest erost us,
Tin I tooke the Hoast for th⁷Hostesse

Thence to Coventre, where 'tis said-a
Coventre ὀίετο is only made-a 3

This Ι know not, for sure am I

In no Market bought Ι any3
Bacchus made me such a Scholer‚
Black nor blew, Ι knew no colour.

Thence to Dzmclmrclz, where report is

Of pimps, punks a great resort is,

But to me none such appeared,

Bung nor Bung-hole Ι ne're feared;
Though the rich Chrone have feares plenty,
Safe he sings whose purse is empty.

At Daintre earely might you find me,
But not th'Wench Ι left behind me,
Neare the Schoole-house where Ι boused,
Her I sought but she was spoused,
Which Ι having heard that night-a,

“ Farewell (quoth Ι) proselyta.
