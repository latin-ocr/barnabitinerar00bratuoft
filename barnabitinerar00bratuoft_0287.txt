Second part.

Thence to wedam, there Ι tarried

In a Waggon to be carried3

Carriers there are to be found-a,

Who will drink tin th' world run round-213

“ Pay, good fellows, I’le pay nought heere,
“ 1 have7¹⁶ lest more than Ι brought heere.

Thence to T osseler on a Tuesday‚
Where an artfull Batchler chus’d Ι
To consort with3 we ne're budged‚
But to Bacchus revels trudged 3
All the Night-long sat we at it

Tin we both grew heavy pated.

Thence to Straffhrd where Fra7zk† Crem-a,
Daintiest Doe that e're was seenea,

Venus varnish me saluted‚

But no beauty long can sute it;

Beauty feedeffl, beauty fadeffi,

Beauty lost, her wooer vadeth.

³⁶ My queasy stomach making bold,
To give them that it could not hold.
† Green is my name from him whom I obey‚
But tho my name be Green, my head is gray.
