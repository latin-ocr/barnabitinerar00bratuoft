 

Bamzabees Jcmmml.
Second part.

Holding on my journey longer,

Streight at Bm‘cleln‘ll with TOM YOUNGER.
I arriv'd3 one by this eheese-a

Styl'd the eighth wiseman of Greecc-a,
Voyce more sweet than Prognes sister,
Like a Torch his nose doth glister.

To Hocklaylmle as Ι approached,
Scylla's barmy cell I broached‚
Darke as th’ Cave of Pluto’s station,
Or Lavemza’s habitation 3

Quaffing there while Ι could stand-o,
Madder grew Ι than Orlandc).

Thence to Dzmstable, all about me 3
Mice within, and Thieves without me ,
But no feare affrights deep drinkers‚
There Ι tost it with my Skinkers3

Not a drop of wit remained

Which the Bottle had not drained.

Thence to Redburne, where were Players‚
N one of Roscius actiue heyres 3

Prologue crown⁷d with a Wreath of Iuy,
Jetted like an Ape most lively :

Ι told them sitting at the *banket

They should be canvas'd in a blanket.

ἦ Actor. Even as in a ban-a-quet are dish-es
Of Sun-dry ta-ast.
Autlzor. Even so is thy doo-blet too long ith xva-ast 3

Goe mend it, thou knave, goe mend it.
