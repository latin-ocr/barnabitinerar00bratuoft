From thence with a stomack empty
To the towne of *Albane went Ι,

W here with wine Ι was so undon,

As the ffimd which guides to London
In my blind hand Ι receaved‚

And her more acquaintance craved.

Thence to th' Purse at Bar-net known—a,
There the Beares were come to Town-a;
Two rude Hunks‚ ’tis troth Ι tell ye,
Drawing neare thern⁷ they did smel] me,
And like two mis—shapen wretches

”Τ City Ι so dearely loved,

And th' Home of Matrzzulation

Drunk to th’ freshmen of our Nati0n‚
To his mernory saluted

Whose branch' d head was last cornuted

ᾖ Here Alban was ; his Tombe, his Title too ;
‘⁶ All Albion shew me such an Alban now.
