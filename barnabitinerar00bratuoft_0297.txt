Second parf.

Under thâ€™ Signe of szpe still fuming,
And the Buslz for ever flaming,
Alalciber the motion moving,

With Nose-burning Master shaming :

A Shop neighbouring neare Iacco,

Where Yeng vends his old TobaccQ

As you like it, sometimes sealed,

Which Impression since repealed9

As you make it, he will have it,

And in Chart and Front engrave it :
Harmlesse but no artlesse end
Cloze I here unto my Friend.
