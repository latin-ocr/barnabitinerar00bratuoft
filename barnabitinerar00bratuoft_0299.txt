 

U pm tlzsse Errata’s.

Etwixt Hawke and Buzzam', ὃ man,
After th' Phraze of speech so c6m0n‚
Having seene this Journall at print,
I found these Erala's in it;
Which if thou correct (Kind Reader)

Nectar by thy Muses feeder.

From the head unto the foot
Nought but Error, looke unto't.

This observation have Ι found most true,
Erring, I learne mine Errors to subdue.
