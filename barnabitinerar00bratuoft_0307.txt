When Ι was by Fortune cuffed‚
”L ' Or by Fortunes smiles so puffed,
As Ι shewd my selfe farre prouder
Than when she more scornfull shewd her?

    

 

For the world, Ι would not prize her,
Yea, in time I should despise her,

Had she in her no good fellow

That would drinke till he grew mellow 3
Draw neare and heare, thou shalt have all,
Hearing, joy in this my travall.

First day having drunk with many,
To Islingz‘en from London came Ι,
Journey long and grievous weffler,
Yet the Ev'ning brought me thether‚
Having t⁷ane my pots by th' fier,
Summer sand was never dryer.

Thence to Kingsland, where were feeding
Cattell‚ Sheepe‚ and Mares for breeding3
As I found it, there I feared

That my Rozinant was weaffed :

When he would Jog on no faster

Loose Ι turn’d him to the pasture.
