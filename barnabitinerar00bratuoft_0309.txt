Thence to Talnam—lnglc-crosse turning,

I departed 'fore next morning3
Hostesse on her Guests so doted
Faustulus was little noted ;

To an Hay-loft I was led in,

Boords my bed, and straw my bedding.

Having thus left flzgh-Crosse early,
Ι to Waltlzam travelled fairly,

To the Hospitall of Oswahi,

And that Princely Seat of *Tk’bald
There all night I drunk old Sack-a

With my bed upon my back-a.

Thence to Hodsdon, where stood watching
Cheats who liv'd by conicatching‚

False Cards brought me, with them plaid Ι.
Deare for their acquaintance paid Ι 3

Them he praised, me he jeered.
