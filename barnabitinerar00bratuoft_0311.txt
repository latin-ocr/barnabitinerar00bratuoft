Bamzczbees Joummll.

T lzz'rd part.

Thence to Ware3 where mazie A mwell
Mildly cuts the Southerne Chanell 3
Rivers streaming, banks resounding,
M'ddleton with wealth abounding:
Mightssy did these delight me3

“O 1 wish'd them Aqua vitae!

Thence to l'Vademz'lL where 1 rest me

For a pot, for Ι was thirstie 3

On me cryde they and did hout me,

And like Beetles flockt about me:

‘⁴ Buy a Whip Sr Ι no, a Laddle3

“ Where's your Horse S‘? where your Saddle?

Thence at Puckridge Ι reposed,
Hundred Beggars me inclosed3

‘⁴ Beggms, quoth Ι, you are many,
“ But the poorest of you am 1 3
They no more did me importune
Leaving me unto my fortune.

Thence to Buntz'ngford right trusty,
Bedrid Host, but Hostesse lusty,
That can chat and chirpe it neassy,
And in secret kisse you sweetly3
Here are arbours decked gaily,
Where the Bantia warbles daily.
