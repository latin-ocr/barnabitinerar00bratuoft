272sz part.

Thence to Reiston, there grasse groweffl,
Medes, flocks‚ fields the plowman soweth‚
Where 3 pious Prince frequented,

Which observing‚ this I vented z

“ Since 311 flesh to ᾗ Fate’s a debter‚

“ Retchlesse wretch, why liv’st no better?

Thence to Caxston, I was led in

To 3 poor house, poorer bedding,

Sorne there were had me suspected
That with plague I was infected,

So as 1 starke-naked drew me,

Calling th'Hostesse streight to view me.

Thence to Cambridge, where the Muses
Haunt the Vz‘ne—bush, as their use is 3
Like sparks up 3 Chimney warming,
Or Flyes neare 3 Dung-hill swarrning,
In a Ring they did inclose rne,
Vowing they would never lose nie.

³⁶ Fields, floods, wasts, woods, Deare, DogS, with well-tun'd
r 7
Are §pyoti'ts for Kings, yet Kings with these must dye.
