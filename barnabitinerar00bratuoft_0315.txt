Third parf.

'Bout mid-night for drinke Ι call St,

AS I had drunk nought at all St,

But all this did little shame me,

Tipsy went Ι, tipsy came Ι z

Grounds, greenes, groves are wet and home1y‚
But the Sclzollers wondrous comely.

Thence to ᾗ Godmanclzester, by one,
With a Clowd as was Ixion,

Was Ι guH'd3 she had no feHow,
Her soft lips were moist ἃς mellow,
All night vow'd she to lye by me,
But the giglet came not ny me.

Thence to Ismzlington, in a cellar
With a wench was there a dweller

1 did bargaine, but suspected

By the Hoast who her affected,
Down the staires he hurr'ed quickly,
While I made me too too sickly.
