 

Bamzabees Journall.

Third part.

Thence to Harringy‘on, be it spoken 1
For N ame-sake Ι gave a taken

To a Beggar that did orave it

And as cheerfully receive it:

More he need't not me importune
For ’twas th'utmost of my fortune.

Thence to Stonegatehole', 1²1 tell here
Of a story that besell there,

One who served an Atturney

T’ane with beauty in his journey,
Seeing a Coppice hastens thither
Purposely to wanton with her.

As these privatly conferred‚

A Rover tooke him unprepared,

Search't his Post-mantua, bound him fasten
And sent him naked to his Master:

Set on's Saddle with hands tyed‚

Th'Horse he neyed, Man he cryed.

Th’ Atturney when he had discerned
One, he thought, behind him armed

In white Armour, stoutly sturr'd him,
For his Jade hee keenly spurr’d him ε
Both run one course to catch a Gudgeon,
This Nak't that frighted to their lodging.
