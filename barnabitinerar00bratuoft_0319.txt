Third part.

Singing along down ἦ Sautry laning,

I saw a Tombe one had beene laine in,
And inquiring‚ One did tell it,

'Twas where Raz'mysord buried th⁷Prelat.·
Ι saw, I smss'd, and could permit it,
Greedy Priests might so be fitted.

To th'Nezctfozmded College came Ι,
Commended to the care of many;
Bounteous are they, kind and loving,
Doing whatsoe’re's behoving :

These hold and walke together wholly,
And state their Lands on uses holy.

Whether pure these are or are not,

As I know not, so I care not3

But if they be dissembling Brotloers,

Their life surpasseth many others :

See but their Cell, Sohoole and their Temple,
You'l say the Stars were their exemple.

ἤ Here of the whip a δανείσω Prz'est did lick ;
Who would not bury th' dead, was buried quick.

Nothing more memorable than that Chappell of Sautry
reteining still with her that Covetous
Priests memory.
