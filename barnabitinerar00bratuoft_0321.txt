Third part.

Thence to Stiltmz, slowly paced,

With no bloome nor blossome graced,
With no plums nor apples stored,

But bald like an old mans forehead3

Yet with Innes so well provided,

Guests are pleas'd when they have tride it.

z Thence to lVanffrllz-brzgs, a river,
And a wife will live for ever 3

River broad, an old wife jouy,
Comely‚ seemely, free from f011y3
Gates and gardens neatly gracious,
Ports and Parks and pastures spatious.

Seeing there, as did become me,
Written, LORD HAVE MERCY ΟΝ ME,
On the Portels, Ι departed,

Lest I should have sorer smarted3
Though from death none may be spared,
Ι to dye was scarce prepared.

On a Hay-cock sleeping soundly,
Th'River rose and tooke me roundly
Downe the current3 people cryed,
Sleeping, down the streame Ι hyed,
[Vleere away, quoth they, from Greenland 2?
Nc) ,· from [Vamfithlz-bmgs in Englaml.
