Barnabees Jozmzall.
T lzz'rd part.

Thence to ἦ Bzcrlezgh, though ’twas winter,
No fire did the Chimney enter,

Buttries without Butlers gwrded,

Stately gates were dooble-warded 3

Hoary † Chimneyes without smooke too.
Hungry Kitchins without Cooke too.

Hallowing loud, ὃ empty wonder!

‡ Ecce streight resounded, lzzmger.
Who inhabits this vast brick—houseZ
Ecco made reply, the Dtmousoe
Ominous Cell, no drudge at home Sir!
Ecce answer made, Be gone Sir.

Thence to ancient §Stamfhrd came Ι,
Where are pencelesse purses many,
Neatly wrought as doth become them,
Lesse gold in them than is on thern ε
Clawbacks more doe not assaile me,
Than are Beggars swarming dayly.

³* This house the Levarets bush.
† Ivy the Chimneis trophy.
ζ Ecco’s the keeper of a forlorne house.

ἓ VVhere be thy Masters ,9 E’llows ? Scholers ,9 Bursam ?
O Slamsord to thy shame, they’r all turn'd Pursers.
