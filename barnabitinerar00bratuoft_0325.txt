Though my cares were maine and many,
To the κ Hele of Sara came Ι,

Once a bona-roba, trust me,

Though now buttock-shrunke and rustie 3
But though nervy-oyle and fat-a,

Her Ι caught by you know what-a.

Having boldly thus adventured,

And my Sara's socket enter'd,

Her Ι sued, suted, sorted,

Bussed, bomed, sneesed‚ snorted:
Often sat she, when she got up

All her phraze was, “ Drink thy pot up.

Thence to W'tlzam, having red there
That the fattest Eele was bred there,
Purposing some to intangle‚

Forth Ι went and tooke mine angle,

Where an huge one having hooked‚
By her headlong was I dooked.†

Where many Mala-worm have been soundly mall’d.

Where waves sound cares, and banks imply our end.
