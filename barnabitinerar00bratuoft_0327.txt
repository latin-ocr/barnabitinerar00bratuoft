Bamlabees Joummll.
Tllirdparl.

Thence to ³⁶ Ga-antlzam Ι retiring,
Famous for a Spire aspirhrg,

There a Pastor with his sweeting
In a chamber closely meeting 3

In great fury out he flung there
'Cause a Paplslz picture hung there.

Here the Townsmen are amated
'l'hat there sz're should be translated
Unto PAUL53 and great's their labour
How to purchase so much paper

To enwrap it, as is fitting,

To secure their Spire from splitting.

Thence to † Abas-werke, fiood-surrounded,
Where I hoping most were drowned,
Hand to hand I straightwayes shored

To a Cellar richly stored,

Till suspected for a picklock‚

Th'Beedle led me to the whip—stock.

ᾗ Ι may compare this Towne, and be no lyer,
With any shire for ltf'lzetstones and a sz'rc.
-Γ Α sandy plat a shady Elme receaves,
Which cloths those Turrets with her shaken leaves.

Here all along lyes Bevars spatious Vale,

Neare which the streames of fruitfull Yrcnt doe fall.
Vallies three so fruitfull be,
They’r the wealth of Britannie.
