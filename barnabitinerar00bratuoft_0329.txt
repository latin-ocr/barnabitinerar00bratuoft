Barnabees Jozmmll.
Tllirdpart.

Thence to szworllz in the clay there,
Where poor Travellers find Such way there 3
Wayes like bird-lime seeme to show them,
Seats are Syrts to such as know them3
Th'Ivy hangs there, long has't hong there,
Wine it never vended strong there.

Thence to Retford, fish Ι fed on,
And to th' adage Ι had red on,
With carouses Ι did trimme me,
That my fish might swim within me,
As they had done being living,

And ith' River nimbly diving.

Thence to Scrubie, ὃ my Maker!

With a Pastor and a T aker

Day I spent, 1 night divided,

Thiefe did make me well provided t
My poor Scrip did cause me feare him,
All night long Ι came not neare him.

Thence to Bautree, as I came there
From the bushes neare the Lane there
Rush'd a Tweake in gesture flanting,
With a leering eye and wanton3

But my fiesh Ι did subdue it,

Fearing lest my purse should rue it.
