Third part.

Thence to ÷÷ Doncaster, where reported
Lively Levit was departed,

Love 1 loath'd and spritely wine too,
Which Ι dearely lov'd sometime too :
For when youthfull Venus ageth‚

She my fleshly force asswageth.

Thirst knowes neither meane nor measure.¹
‚Robz'lz Hoeds Well was my measure,

In a common ἦ· dish enchained‚

Ι my furious thirst restrained :

And because I drunk the deeper,

I paid two sarthings to the keeper.

Thence to ξ lVentbrzg, where vile wretches,
Hideous hags and odious witches,
Writhen count'nance and mis-shapen

Are by some foule Bugbeare taken:

These infernall seats inherit‚

Who contract with such a Spirit.

'³ That curt’sie might a curtesie enforce,
The Asayre would bring the Lawyer to his horse t
Yon shall not, quoth the Lawyer ; M. now l swearc‘.
I'le to tlze gallows goe. L. l'le leaveyou there,
Might not this fllayre for wit a second Pale-As
Have nam'd the T own—end full as well as Gallows :³

Ἰ· Α Well, tharne, dislz hung in an iren clzaine,
For monuments of Robz'n Hood remaine.

‡ In a rock XVant built her booth,
XYhere no creature dwels but Sloth.
