T lzird part.

Thence to Ferrybrzg‚ sore wearied,
Surfoot, but in spirit cheered 3

I the grape no sooner tasted
Than my melancholy wasted 3

N ever was wild anre more fellish‚
Though the wine did smally relish.

Thence to *Pomfraia as long since is,
Fatall to our † English Princes 3

F or the choicest ζ Licerice crowned,
And for sundry acts renowned:

A Louse in Pemfrczz‘t is not surer,
Then the Poor through sloth securer.

Thence to Slzerbumze, dearely loved,

And for Pinners well approved3

Cherry tenths the Pastor aymeth

More than th' soules which he reclaimeth :
In an Equi-page consorting

Are their manners and their fortune.

ἶ The Tragick stage of English kings stood here,
Which to their urns payes tribute with a teare.

† Here stood that satan Theatre of Kings,
Which for revenge mounts up with aery wings.

ζ Here Lz'corlce grows upon their mellowed banks,
Decking the Spring with her delicious plants.
