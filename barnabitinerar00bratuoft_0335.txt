Thirdpczrt.

Thence to Bramlzam‚ thither comming,

I saw two Footmen stript for running3

One told me, ‘⁶ th’ match was made to cheat the,
‘⁴ Trust me Faustulus, lez's will beat'em‚

‘⁴ For we've tride them : but that Courser

He priz’d better, prov⁷d the worser.

Thence to Tadcaster‚ where stood reared
A faire Bfldge, where no flood appeared,
Broken Pavements‚ Beggars waiting,
Nothing rnore than labour hating,

But with speed I hastned from them,
Lest I should be held one of thern.

Thence to Yorke‚ fresh youth enjoying
With a wanton llf'eaver toying‚

Husband suddenly appeares too

“ Catching of the Wolfe by th'Eares t003
He cryes open, something feares him,
But th’deafe Adder never heares him.

Thus my entrance was descried‚
While the lVeaver was denied‚

Who as he fumed, fret, and frowned,
With a chamber-pot was crowned 3
Wisely silent he ne’re grndged
While his Betly with me lodged.
