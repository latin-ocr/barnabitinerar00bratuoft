 

Barnabees Journall.

leird part.

A Piper being here committed,

Guilty found, condemn'd and titted,

As he was to Iozavesmyre going,

lez's day, quoth Boyes, will spoile tlzy bl07c1l'72g;
From tlzy Pzpe llc'art now departz'7zg;

lVags‚ quoth th'Piper, χοῶν not cerlaine.

All which happen'd to our wonder,

For the halter eut asunder,

As one of 311 life deprived

Being buried, he revived ε

And there lives, and plays his measure,
Holding hanging but 3 pleasure.

Thence to Towlertmt, where those Stagers
Or Horse-eoursers run for wagers 3

Neare to the high way the course is,
Where they ride and run their horse53
But still on our journey went we,

first, or Last, did like content me.

Thence to H'elperby I turned
Desolate and lately burned,

Not 3 Taphouse there but mourned,
Being all to ashes turned,

Whence Ι swiftly did remove me
For thirst-sake, as did behove me.
