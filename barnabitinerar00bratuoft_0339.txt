Third part.

Thence to ὕ Topcliffi’‚ musick call’d Ι,

In no cornely posture fail'd Ι,

But when these expected wageS,

To themselves Ι left my Pages3

Small being th'curt⁷sy Ι could shew thern
Th’reckning Ι commended to thern.

Thence to † Thyrslee, rich Thyrsis casket,
Where faire Phyllis fils her basket

With choice flowers, but these be vaine things,
Ι esteeme no flowers nor Swainlings 3

In Bacchus yard, field, booth or cottage

Ι love nought like his cold pottage.

Thence to Allertmz, rankt in battelL
Sheepe‚ Kine, Oxen, other Cattell‚
As Ι fortun'd to passe by there

Were the Towns best beautifier z
Faire for Beasts at that time fell there,
But Ι made my Fayre the Celler.

³⁶ Topclz‘ e from tops of cliffs first tooke her name,
And her cliffe-mounted seat confirms the same z
where streames with curled windings overflowne

Bestow a native beauty on the towne.

Here Thyrsis fed his Lambkins on the Plaine,
So T lzyrske from Thyrsis tooke her ancient Name.

Here Tityrus and Phyllis made them Bowers
Of tender Osyers, sweet-breath'd Sycomours.
