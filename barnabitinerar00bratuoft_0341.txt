 

Bamabees Joztmczll.

T lzird part.

Thence to Smetmz, 1 assailed

Lowsy· Hill, for so they call it,

Where were dainty Ducks, and gant ones,
Wenches that could play the wantons,
Which they practice, truth I'le tell ye,
For reliefe of back and bellie.

Thence to ³⁶ Neslzam, now translated,
Once a Nunnery dedicated ;

Vallies smiling‚ Bottoms pkasing,
Streaming Rivers never ceasing‚
Deckt with tufty woods and shady‚
Graced by a lovely Lady.

Thence to Darlz'zzgiom there Ι boused
Till at last I was espoused3

Marriage feast and all prepared,

Not a fig for th' world Ι cared3

All night long by th' pot Ι tarried

As if I had ne're beene married.

’ἓ VVhere shores yeeld Lenticks‚ briches pearled gems,
Their Lamprels shells, their rocks soft mossy stems.
