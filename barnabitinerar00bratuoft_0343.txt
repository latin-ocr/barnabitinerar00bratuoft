 

Bamzczbees Joumczll.

T lzz'rd part.

Thence to ⁹⁶ Rz’clzmund, heavy sentence 1
There were none of my acquaintance,
All my noble Cumrads gone were,

Of them all Ι found not one there,

But lest care should make me sicker,

I did bury care in liquor.

Penance chac⁷d that crime of mine hard,
Thence to Redmeere to a Swine-lzeard
Came I, where they nothing plast me
But a Swines-gut that was nasffie,

Had I not then wash'd my liver.

In my guts't had stuck for ever.

Thence to Carperbie very greedy,
Consorts frequent, victuals needy5
After Supper they so tost me

As seven shillings there it eost me ;
Soone may one of coyne be soaked,
Yet for want of liquor choaked.

³⁶ From a Rz'clz mound thy appellation came,
And thy rich seat proves it a proper name.
