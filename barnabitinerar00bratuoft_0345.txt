Third part.

Thence to VVenchly, Valley·seated,
For antiquity repeated 3

Sheep and Sheepheard as one brother
Kindly drink to one another3

Till pot-hardy light as feather

Sheep and Shepheard sleep together.

Thence to Affz’ddlanz, where I viewed
T h’ Castle which so stately shewed 3
Down the staires‚ 'tis truth Ι tell ye,
To a knot of brave Boyes fell 13

All red-nosen, no dye deeper,

Yet not one but a peace-keeper.

Thence to ³⁶ A yscmffz, from a mountaine
Fruitfull vallies, pleasant fou'ntaine,
Woolly flocks, cliffs steep and snowy‚
Fields, fenns, sedgy rushes saw 13
Which high Mount is call'd the Temple,
For all prospects an exemple.

ἅ Here breaths an arched cave of antique stature,
Closed above with thorus, below with water.
