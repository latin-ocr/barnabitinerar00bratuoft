Third pa rl.

Thence to Worten, being lighted

I was solemnly invited

By a Captains wife most vewlie‚

Though‚ Ι thinke‚ she never knew me3

I came, call⁷d‚ coll'd‚ toy’d, trifi’d, kissed,
“ Captaine Cornu-cap'd I wished.

Thence to Baz'nbmgg, where the River
From his channell seemes to sever,
To Asaidelzh) Jolm I forthwith hasted‚
And his best provision tasted3
Th’hoast 1 had (a thing not common)
Seemed neither man nor woman.

Thence to ⁹⁶ Askrng, market noted,
But no handsomnesse about it,
Neither Magistrate nor Mayor
Ever were elected there:

Here poor people live by knitting‚
To their Trafflng, breeding sitting.

'⁶ A Channell strait confines a chrystall spring,
&Vashing the wals oth' village neighbouring.
