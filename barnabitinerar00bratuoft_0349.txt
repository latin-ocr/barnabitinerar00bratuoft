T lcird part.

Thence to *Hm-dmm where's hard hunger,
Barraine cliffs and clints of wonder 3

Never here Adonis lived,

Unlesse in Celes Harbour hived:

Ins are nasty, dusty‚ fusffie,

Both with smoake and rubbish mustie.

Thence to Gastz'le‚ I was drawne in
To an Alelcouse neare adjoining

To a Chappell, I drunk Stz'ngo
With a Butcher and Domingo

Th' † Curat, who to my discerning
Was not guilty of much learning.

Thence to ζί Sedberglc, sometimes joy-all,
Gamesome, gladsome‚ richly royall‚
But those jolly boyes are sunken,

“ Now scarce once a yeare one drunken ε
There I durst not well be merry,
Farre from home old Foxes werry„

 

ἐ Α shallow Rill, whose streames their current keep,
With murm'ring voyce ἃ pace procure sweet sleep.

† 1 askt him what's a Clock? He look'd at th’ Sun t
But want of Latin made him answer Mum.

ζ Here grows a buslz in artfull mazes round,
Where th’ active organs of my braine were drownd.
