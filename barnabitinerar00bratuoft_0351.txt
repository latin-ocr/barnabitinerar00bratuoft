T bird part.

Thence to *Killz'nglon I passed,
Where an hill is freely grassed,
There I staid not though halfe-tyred,
Higher still my thoughts aspired :

T aking leave of mountains many,
To my native Country came Ι.

Thence to Kendall, pure her state is,
Prudent too her Magistrate is,

In whose charter to them granted
Nothing but a † Mayor wanted 3
Here it likes me to bee dweffing,
Bousing, loving‚ stories telling.

ἦ Here the retyred T anner builds him bowrs‚
Shrowds him from Summers heat and winters showrs.

† Now Saturus yeare h'as drench’d down care,
And made an Alderman a lllayre.
