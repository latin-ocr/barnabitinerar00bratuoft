His Northerne Journey :

lee Foztrtlz part.

FAUSTULUS‚ takes't no pitty

x L For the Field to leave the City?
{sart thgaCssnsogtss lssveg Skssnfflers,
Lads of nse, tho xffaffssheilrlsnzerrm ω’ ’
And are dry and thirsty ever?

  

wilt thou here no longer tarrie

With these boyes that love Canarie?
Wilt thou leave these nectar trenches‚
Dainty DoxeS, merry wenches ?

Say, what makes thee change thy ditty,
Thus to take farewell oth'City?
