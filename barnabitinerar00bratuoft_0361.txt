Which I lov'd, and by it undon.

F arewell Bunlz‘ngfmd, where are Thrushes,
Sweet Briers, Shred vines, privet bushes,
Hostesse cheerefulL mildly moving,
Giving tokens of her loving3

Take my fill of recreation.

Farewell pretious stone, and Chappell

Where Stella shines more fresh than th' apple,

Meedes and Mates of George α Greene-a.

 

 

These be my A'ezo Troyes dying Elegies.
Now to that A'ew Troy bid adue for ever,
VVine, Venus, Picum-es, can allure me never,
These are youths darlingz, ages hoary griever,
Fare ye well ever.

Farewell for ever, see you will I never,

Yet if Wife‚Chi1<i1·,en Meney hurry thether‚

WVhere we may p] ant and solace us together,
W elcome sor ever.
