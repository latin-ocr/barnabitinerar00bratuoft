 

Barnabees Jozcmall.
Fomtlc part.

1 arn now become a Dmver,

Countrey·liver‚ Countrey-lover‚

Smell of gaine my sense benummeth‚

Little care Ι whence it commeffl,

Bee't from Campe, chore, cottage‚ carpet,

Field, sold, cellar, forrest, market.
Herse-Fa ires.

To Mallon come I, praising th'saile Sir,

Of an horse without a taile Sir,

Be he maim’d, larn’d, blind, diseased‚

If I 5611 him, I'rn well pleased3

Should this Javell dye next morrow,

Ι partake not in his sorrow.

Then to Rz‘ppon Ι appense there

To sell horse if they be deare there,
If good cheape, I use to buy them,
And ith’Country profit by them 3

“ Where to quicken them, I’le tell ye,
“ Ι put quick Eeles in their bellie.

Λό νΗιε rue Fa ires.

Thence to Pomfrasz‘, freshly flowred,

And with ÷÷ rods of Licorice stored3
Thence to Zyfficlg'ffe with my sellow‚

Not to bouze Wine but to sell-105

Thence to Thyrslee, where Bullocks grazed‚
Are for sale ith'market placed.

ἦ Rods of Licorice sweetly smile

In that rich Angelick I‘le.
See Book 3. Stanz. 48.
