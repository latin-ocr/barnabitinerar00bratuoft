Thence to Allerton cheerefulL fruitfull,
To the Seller very gratefull‚

There to chuse a place I’ni chariest‚
Where my beasts inay shew the fairest ;
Thence to Darlt'szglmt, never swarving
From our Drove-lawes, worth observing.

Thence to Asl'ddlam am I aiming

In a direct course of gaining‚

I refuse no kind of labour,

Where I smell sonie gainsull savour3

Tra montane F a ires.

In these Faires if I finde nothing
Worthy παγίως, I'm no slow thing,
To the AVot-lle frasne Ι my passage
Wing’d with hope of rnore advantage :
Ragged rocks, and steepy hillows
Are by gaine more soft than pillows.

Thence to native Appleble mount Ι,
Th'antient Seat of all that County3
Thence to pearelesse Petzrt‘tlc went I,
Which of Merchandize hath plenty 3
Thence to Roslay‚ where our Lot is
To commerce with people Scottislz.
