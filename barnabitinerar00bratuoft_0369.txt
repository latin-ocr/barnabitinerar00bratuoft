Fourllz part.

By a passage crooktly tending,
Thence to lx'aw'nglasse I’m bending3
Thence to Ballou most delightfull3
Thence to oaten Θασίου fruitfull;
Thence to Hanxides marish pasture3
Thence to th'Seat of old Lancaster.

Thence to Garestcmg‚ where are feeding
Heards with large fronts sreely breeding3
Thence to [nglefhrslc I descended,
Where choice Bull-calfs will be vended3
Thence to Burlmzs boundiers passe 1,
Faire in fiocks‚ in pastures grassie.

Thence to Hornebie, Seat renouned,

“ Thus with gaine are worldlings drowned;
Secret-sacred thirst of treasure

Makes my Bullocks my best pleasure3
Should Leve wooe me, I'd not have her,

“ It is gaine yelds sweetest savour.

Thence to Lenes-dale, where were at it
Boyes that scorn'd quart—ale by statute,
Till they stagger’d, stammer'd, stumbled‚
Railed, reeled‚ rowled‚ tumbled,
Musing Ι should be so stranged,

I resolv'd them, I was changed.
