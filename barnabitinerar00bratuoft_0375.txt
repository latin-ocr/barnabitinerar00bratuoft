‚ms-fv«, Hou err ’st (sllirtz'lus) so doe mo too.
If thou ‘think’ st Ι never goe to
Bacchus temple, which Ι follow,

“Once a yeare laughs wise Apollo·
W here Ι drench gliefes, slei-g ht Phy sitians,
Hayre Ι change, obUt no conditions.

  

Cheerefull Cumrades have 1 by me,
Townsmen that doe neighbour ny me,
W ithin, without, where e're Ι rest me,
Carking cares doe ne're molest me 1
With these Ι please to consort me,
And in ἦ open fields to sport me.

Now to Riclzmmzd, when Spring⁷s comming,
Now t0⁸Neslzam with my woman,

With free course we both approve it,
Where we live and are beloved 3

Here fields flower with freshest creatures
Representing filora's features

ἰ’ Thus through the faire fields, when Ι have best leasure,
Diapred riehly, doe I take my pleasure‚
To chee1·e my studies with a pleasing measure.
