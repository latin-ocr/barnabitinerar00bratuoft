Bamabees Jozzrlzczll.

Fourtlt part.

Now to Aslze‘mz I'm invited

By my friend and kinsman cited,

Secret cellars entertaine me,
Beauteous-beaming Stars inflame me,
Meam, mirth‚ musick‚ wines are there full,
With a count'nance blith and cherefull.

Now to Combrow, quickly thither
Joviall boyes doe fiock together,

In which place all sorrow lost is,

Guests know how to kisse their hostesse,
Nought but love doth border neare it,
Goose or Hen will witnesse beare it.

Now to Natland, where choice beauty
And a Shepheard doe salute me,

Lz'ps Ι relish riehly roseack,

Purely Nectar and A mbroseack ,-

But I’m chaste‚ as doth become me,
For the Countreys eyes are on me.

Now to Kirkland, truly by it

May that Say be verified,

“ Farfrom God, bnt neare llze Temple,
Though their Pastor give exemple‚
They are such a kind of vermin,

Pipe they’d rather heare than Sermon.
