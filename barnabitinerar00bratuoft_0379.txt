Fourtlz part.

Now to Kendall‚ for ⁹⁶ Cloth-rnaking,
Sight‚ site, †Alderma7z awaking,
Beauteous Damsels, modest mothers,
And her foure and twenty brothers,
Ever in her honour spreading,
Where I had my native breeding.

Where I'le tell you (while none mind us)
We throw th'house quit out at windows,
Nought makes thern or me ought sory,
They dance lively with solm Dori.-
Holy Brethren with their Poet

Sing, nor care they much who know it.

Now to Stavelqy streight repaire Ι,
Where sweet Birds doe hatch their airy,
Arbours‚ Osyers freshly showing

With soft niossie rinde offe-growing:
For woods, ayre, ale, all excelling,
XVould'st thou have a neater dwelling?

⁹⁶ A Towne so highly renouned for her commodious cloathing‚

and industrious Trading, as her name is become famous in
that kind. Camb. in Brit.

Cloflc is my bread. Mot.
† Now hast thou chang’d thy title unto M‘ay're,
Let life, state, style improve thy charter there·
