Reazkr, thinke no wonder by it,

If with Towne I've Towne supplied,
If my meeters backward nature

Set before what should be later,
“As for instance is exprest there,
Harrz‘ngton after Godmatzclzester.

What though brieves too be made longo’s .-⁹
What tho vowels be dz’ptlzongo’s ?

What tho graves become acute too?

What tho accents become mute too ?

What tho sreely, fully, plainly

I've broke Priscians forehead mainly?

What tho seat with seat I've strained ?
What tho my limpe-verse be maimed?
What tho Night I've t'ane for Day too?
What tho I’ve made bryers my way too?
Know ye, I’ve declin'd most bravely
