 

To Philoxenus,

ΓὟᾏΗΕΕ, pleasing way-mates'titled have their

  

,ὦ . patron,

21& Their Countreys glory, which they build
their state on,

The Poets wine-bush, wch they use to prate on,

Arts mery minion.

ῃ In Lyrick measures doth thy Bard salute thee,

Who with a constant resolution suits thee,

Nor can ought move me to remove me fr& thee
But my religion.
