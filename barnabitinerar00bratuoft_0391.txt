DAMAETAS. ELIZA-BELLA.

1.

. Y bonny Bell, I love thee so well,

' ¹», I would thou wad scud a lang bether,
,ζ’ , That we might here in a Cellar dwell,

And blend our bows together!

Deere a’rt to me as thy geere’s to thee,

The Warld will never suspect us,

This place it is private, ’tis folly to drive it,

Loves Spies have no eyes to detect us.

 

2.

IEL. Trust me Damoetas, youth will not let us,
Yet to be cing'd with loves taper‚

Eonny blith Swainlin intend thy Lamkin,

'Io requite both thy layes and thy labour.
Ilove not thee, why should'st thou love me,
'Ihe yoake Ι cannot approve it,

'Ihen lye still with one, I'de rather have none,
Bor 1 love, nor am lov'd‚ nor have loved.

EAM. To lead Apes {n hell, it will not do well,
''Jis an enemy to procreation‚

h the world to tarry and never to marry
Vould bring it soone to desolation.

See my countnance is merry, cheeks red as chery‚
'Ihis Cover will never suspect us,

'Ihis place it is private, 'tis folly to drive it,
Loves Spyes have no eyes to detect us
