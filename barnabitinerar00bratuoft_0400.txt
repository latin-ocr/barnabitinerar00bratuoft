‘brown dozen ' of votaries to drinking has been
delineated by a contemporary writer, as each possess-
ἶ ing a particular bias and fixed character. Barnaby was
3 one of these, and intended to exhibit a jovial tippler
although only a ‘maudlin-drunkard.’ Such a one as
the precise water-drinker must fancy is never actually
sober, and yet at the close of a hard bout‚ the reason
not being totally eclipsed, is never supposed actually
drunk. Thus from an extremely rare tract⁹⁶ is ob—
tained an outline of our bibacious Itinerant.
