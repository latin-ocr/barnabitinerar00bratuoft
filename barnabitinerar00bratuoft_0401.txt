‘⁶ Of Drunketz Barnabee. With whom to make a 0

short dispatch‚ and to trusse up his humor in a paper
halter‚ because we have dwelt too long upon Helluoh‚
this Barnabee, ali-ass Maudlin—drunk‚ besides the de-
scription that his proper new Ballad makes of him, as
drunke all nzgrlzt and [ἰν] in tlte morning, his catch being
‘Still one tooth is dry,’ like one old ChamberIaine,
called old Twitcher in Yorkshire‚ who though he had

and Tinkers, he feecls these spaniels which sawne upon him with
good lappings from the tap.'’

7. Drunken Laurente, ali-ass Lusty-gruts.—“ Vv'hen he puts off
his considering cap ancl puts on his barly cap as he begins to be
a friend to Bacchus and Ceres, he shewes himselfe no soe to

Venus—This late Lusty Laurence that Lancashire lad, who had ξ

17 bastards in one year, if we believe his ballad, aster his ale-

mash and hot provender, is a stallion that neighs aster every *

female filly.’'

8. Drunkm Don Qut‘xot, ali-ass Wittypolh—Of a sudden by
the fumes of Bacchus a mushrump poet, never so good a poetaster
as when a pot-taster. “ His pen pricks sharper than a porcu-
pine's, his ink is as strong as his drink‚ it peirceth into a man’s
brains in jerking Iainbicks and pricking Satyres sharper than

the bristles of a hedge-hogg, it were able to make another ¹

Hipponax go hang himselfe.''

9.bDrunken Spermologus.—A word-minter, a Coriatized Od-
com .

10. Drunken philautus.—Drunk with selfe-conceit as well as ὶ

wine. “ No sooner a note above Ela in his maultified mentall
musick‚ but then especially he conceits all his geese to be swans,
his capons cocks, his goats sheep, his rats rabbits, and his glow-
worms blazing-stars.''

11. Drunken Szp-Sobrius.—“ A strange hermaphrodite that
in one houre changeth from drunk to sober.’'

12. Drunkm Clericus, or Simplzb'us.——“ The Countrey Vicar‚
who to his meat must have liquor.”

13. Drunken T om T ell-troatlz.—What is to be known tell him,
“he would vent it sooner in his eupS‚ then if I told it in a
barber’s shop, a mill, a market, a schoole-house amongst boye8‚
a bakehouse amongst wenches, or at a gooseup's feast.⁷'
