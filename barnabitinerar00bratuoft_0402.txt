tested he was yet dry for all that : but passing by that
humour, which hath some coincidence with Helluohs‚
this our maultified maudlin is but halfe drunk and
halfe sober, like a newter in religion, halfe a protestant,
halfe a papist, halfe light, halfe darkenesse, like a twi-
light3 or as a luke warme Laodicean professor half
hot, half cold‚ or indeed his true Hierogliphick is an
Archized, T arltonized Buffon, half a fooI, half a knave 3
