ἦ family should be reserved to this place has arisen
ι from the novelty it offers to our consideration in ex-
} hibitin g the name of Barnabee among the near relatives
¹ of Brathwait. His father, as already stated, married
Dorothy, daughter of Robert Byndloss of Haylston,
. whose wife was Agnes, daughter of Harrison.
