'³⁶ Brathwait's knowledge os this character, who “ for ballads i
never had pee1·‚’‘ was not discovered when the last edition was
printed. 'she original epitaph on Elderton is given in the
“ Remains aster Death,’' 1618, with a translation and comment, ι
thus—

“ That of one Elderton (an inscription too bitter) yet to dis-
authorize that sin, (which, like that powersull ointment whereof ζ
Apuleius relates‚ amongst the '1'l1essalonians‚ transforming and Ι
metamorphosing men into bruite beasts) to wit drunkennesse, i
whereos he was taxed, nothing can be too vehement or violent : J
Hic situs est sitiens alque ebrius Eldertonus ,· i
Quid dico laic situs est ? lzic polius situs est.

Camd. in Remaz'ns.

Heere drunken Elderton in earth lies thrust,
Lies thrust (say I) or rather heere lies thirst.

Again, in A'ature‘s Embassie, 1621, at p. 130, is the following
marginal note to the ninth Satyr “ of Epicurisme.'’

‘f Resembling one Eldert0n‚ on whom this inscription was
writ :

“ Here lieth drunken Elderton, in earth now thrust ;
What said Ι thrust? nay‚ rather here lies thirst.'’

In Rem. osa grealer PVorke.

This Epitaph was imitated by another hand in the following
lines On a Drunkard:

“ ——- the drunkard? while he liv‘d would say,
The more I drinke the more me thinks I may :
But see how death hath prov'd his saying just,
For he hath drunke himselfe as dry as dust.’'

See Wit⁷s Recreations, 1640.

ἥ Later editions read ‘ Bibax the drunkard.¹
