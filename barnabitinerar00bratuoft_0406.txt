information.

The “ old tune of Barnabe‚’' or, as elsewhere
named, ‘³ old catch of lW⁷z00p Barnaby,⁷' has escaped
all research, however ardently and extensively pursued
within the last sixty years, sor the purpose of reviving
our ancient music and balladS.

The popularity of the wordS‚ or tune, or both, first

’ appears by the character of ‘⁴ Barnabe, a hir'd coach-

man‚'⁷ being introduced by Ben Jonson once in a
scene of the comedy of lee new Inn, or llze lzglzt
Heart. The slight connection of this chararcter with
the development of the story of the drama renders
the name of Barnabae too trifiing for any other pur-
poses of Jonson than in part to personify a favourite

Ἰ old catch, and thereby to secure applause from the

‘groundlings' and gallery. Barnabe, the hired

, coachman, having driven to Barnet, is “as drie as
g dust,'⁷ and inquires of Jordan, the landlord‚ an old
ξ acquaintance—-

Keep they their penny-club, still?

or. And th' old catch too,
Of Whoop Barnaby.

Bar. Doe they sing at me?

Bar. I’le to 'hem : Gi’ mee a drinke first.
Jor. Where's thy hat?
Bar. I lost it by the way : Gi' me another.

Jonson again mentions this catch in a Masque that

’ was performed several times at Court, called lee

Gypsies, where a pilfering Gypsy is described to have
