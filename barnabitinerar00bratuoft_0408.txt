You city dames so dainty, that are so neat and fine,
That every day drinks plenty of spice and claret wine,
But you must have it burnt with sugar passing sweet,

³ Χ ou clerks and lawyers costly, that are so fine and nice,

XX hen you do meet so costly, with 3 cup of ale and spice, Α

ῑ Although §ou steale him privatly, 5011 count it is no sin,

Though Barnaby standsopen, in sight of every one,
Whati canpnot you 'tend your drinking, and let Barnaby

But Ι have seen some hostis, that have taken 3 pott,

XX'hen her head runns giddy, she’l eall for a double shott,

Although she gets her living by such kind of gests,

Shall mock, scoffe, and deride me, as deeply as the rest,

But call me drunken Barnaby when all my money is gon,

But cannot they look to their mault man, and let Barnaby
alone ?'' ³*
