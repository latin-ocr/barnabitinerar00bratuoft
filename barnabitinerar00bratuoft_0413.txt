In a clowde ? it's rather showne‚
Like the man that's in the moone‚
XVhere our Iles Ardelio,

Descants of Tom Trinkillo ;
Form⁷d like one that's all in mist,
Like a second Alchymist.

Single ; whereas such need lesse
As themselves to marriage giue,
For these want what they possesse ;

Broken sleeps in many men.⁷'

Nature's Embassie‚ 1621, p. 254.

Which is of this humour sicke,
And in sleep consumes her time,
Ruine to states politicke :

W hen they hold themselves least sure.''
