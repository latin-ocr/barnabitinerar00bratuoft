Nor will he dresse his meat the Sabbath day,

Which doth a mighty mysterie vnfold,

His zeale is hot, although his meat be cold,

Suppose his cat on Sunday kill a rat,
She on the Munday must be hang’d for that.'' ⁴*

And flies go supperlesse to bed :
Or with some close-par⁷d Brother, where
Thoul't fast each Sabbath in the yeare,
Or else, profane, be hang’d on Monday,
For butchering a Mouse on Sunday.’' †
