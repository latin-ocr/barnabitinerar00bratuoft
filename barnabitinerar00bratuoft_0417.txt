That the great sin, l

oblong‚ no date (about 1740), corrected by a copy in manuscript
from the collection of a literary gentleman.—Mr Franks of ¹

“popular country song,’' and entitled the Camcronian Cat„ .

of the time of James II. ; but it was undoubtedly levelled
against the unbending Oliverians‚ who never intended a king
should enjoy his own again. Mr Hogg describes it as “ always s
sung by the wags in mockery of the great pretended strictness ’

of the Covenanters. ’² i
