The substance of the horn itself is semitransparent‚
like tortoiseshell. It was presented to the College
by the foundreSS‚ Philippa, queen of Henry 111. 3 and,
according to tradition, served to convey a valuable
manor in Dorsetshire. It is still used very fre-

* quently on gaudies and festivals, and contains two
quarts winchester measure.
It 1s richly ornamented with gold. The eagle on
Ι the top of the lid is hollow; while the other end, or
tip‚ terminates with the head of a leopard‚ or some
i other heraldic animal, curved round <towards the
Ε animal's right) to the body of the horn, and appears
ἦ in the act of snarling. On the circular border sur-
} rounding the elevated centre of the cover on which
¹, the bird stands, the legend masszgl occurs thrice3
ζ also repeated as often on the rim of gold nearest
l the lip3 and again upon the rim to which the two
ῗ fore-feet are attached ; but not on that supported by
i the hind-leg. A semicircle of gold connects the
extremities of the talons of each foot to each other3
ὲ but the hind-claw of each of the three legs stands

ζ unconnected.
