for drinking a yard of ale. Of the Wassail our
author says—-

‘⁶ Every day we dranke our Sheepherds health
In wassell cups ; not caring for our heards,
How well or ill they far’d, a figg for wealth,
VVee made our chopps wagg, and our grisled beards.’' ξ

Donec creta fregit fidem] A poetical fiction. Our
author states in the Address to Mon. Bacchus,

 

“I could say, and truly say, far more,

Ι neuer ran ten shillings on thy skore,

Which may seem strange, that Ι which am so grown
Into acquaintance, and to thee well knowne,

Should in thy booke haue such a diffidence,
As not be chalkt for want of ready pence.'' †

Gallam] There seems intended a humorous
transposition of the proverbial wisdom of the men
to the women of Gotham. The female gull dancing
in moonshine was probably founded on an accident
which happened in the presence of Brathwait‚ who
relates it as a maol point, whether to ascribe the
same to Fate or the Taylor.

“ Upon a time it chanced that I came

To Cottam, a small towne nere Nottingham,
About which time they kept a solemne wake,
Where every liuely lad tooke in his make, 2:
Each lasse her lad, so as you need not feare
But ere they parted they made dancing deare ;
Amongst the rest a frolicke youth there was,
Who tooke to him a lustie bouncing lasse ;
