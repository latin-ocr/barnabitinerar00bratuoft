W'akffield] Every description of the valiant Pindar
is worth preserving: the following lines are from the 1
poem To tlze Costonmsff⁶

 

‘⁶ that Ι intend to show,

Is merry Wakefield and her Pindar too ;

Which farne hath blaz'd‚ with all that did belong
Unto that towne in many gladsome song :

The Pindars valour‚ and how firme he stood

In th' towne's defence 'gainst th' rebel Robin-hood, ,
How stoutly he behav'd himselfe, and would, ᾗ

 

In spite of Robin, bring his horse to th' fold:

His many May games which were to be seene,

Yeerely presented upon Wakefield greene‚ l

VVhere louely Jugge and lustie Tibb would go,

To see Tom liuely turne vpon the toe 3

Hob‚ Lob, and Crowde the fidler would be there,

And many more Ι will not speake of here ε

Good God ! how glad hath been this hart of
mine

To see that towne, which hath in former time

Whereat some laught‚ while others tooke some ruth,
That she vncas’d, should shew the naked truth.''

v Breaking the points was a common joke against the prevail-
ing sashion. A similar incident is related in Kempes Nz'ne
’ Dayes szder, 1600, as happening when he arrived at the
Cross at Norwich.
