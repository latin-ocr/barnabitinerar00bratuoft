i Giggleswick] The scenery of this place is accu-
} rately delineated by our author. The ‘ fresh spring'

 

that continually ebbs and flows is described by Dray-
ton in his Polyolbz'0n‚ Song 28th, first published in

from a manuscript poem by another popular writer of

It ebbes and flowes ech quarter of an howre.'' '¹⁶

appears uselessly or inadvertently introduced by the ι

She laid her staffe, whence comes the name Staffelay ;
Corruptly Staulay, where she staid a space,
But seeing it a most notorious place,
