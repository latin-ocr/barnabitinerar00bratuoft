 

thereos famous for its eminent height, were at that
present likely to fall into ruin,' expressing at the same
time an utter inability to repair it. In this state it seems
to have remained till 1661, when it was blown down
and rebuilt. The engravings of Hollar, and the history
of Dugdale, represent St. Paul's at the time Barnabee
travelled as wanting only a spire to complete the build-
ing, and it is likely that the gossip ran among those
who shared drunken Barnabee's compotations, that
this elegant spire of Grantham was about to be trans-

planted thence to perfect the splendid cathedral of

St. Paul's.-G2'lclzr2'st.

To this communication of a literary friend we are
enabled to add Brathwait's relation of the same story

ζ in another work. It is introduced in the Arcadian

Princess, with the name of GRANTAM transposed into
MARGANT, and may therefore be unhesitatingly applied
to that place. An index hand is placed in the margin
better to secure notice. ff “They may wel seem
to be ranked and endenized amongst that credulous

÷ plebeian society of Asargant, who were made to beleeve,
ξ upon the ruines of a sumptuous and magnificent abbey-

spire, that the State intended their spire (though many
miles distant, should supply it ε to divert which intend-
ment‚ in all humble and petitionary manner, with joynt
consent according to their weak conceit, they
beseeched the State (with ample gratuities to some
interceding favorites, for their better successe) to
commiserate their case, and spare their spire. To
which the State, pretending thern all favour, after
much laughter, pleasantly condescended.'' ⁹⁶
