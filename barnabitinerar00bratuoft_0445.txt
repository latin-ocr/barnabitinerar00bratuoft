Tadcaster] “Really <says Carnden)‚ considering 3
the many currents that sall into [the Wherf] this .
ζ so shallow and easie stream under the bridge is ·
τ very strange, aud might well give occasion to what a
⁵ certain gendeman, who passed it in the summer-time, 4
, said ofit—

‘ Nil Tadcaster habet Musis vel carmine dzgnnm,
Praeter magng'fic? structum sineflumine pontem.

‘ Nothing at Tadcaster deserves a name,
But the fair bridge that⁷s built without a stream! ’⁷³‘

Neslzam] At this town there was a Benedic- j
tine Nunnery, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and 4
of which no vestige remains. Here Margaret,
sister of Henry VIII„ slept in her progress to Scot-
land. The last prioress was Johanna Lawson, who
remained an annuitant in 1553. It was granted i
32 Hen. VIII. to James Lawson‚ who appears to ,
have been great-grandfather of Frances L.‚ who i
married R. Braithwait. Nesham is in the parish ξ

’ Camden's Britannia. Ι·
