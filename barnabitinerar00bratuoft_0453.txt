sublime, ancl worthy of that heroick scene which
follows.''

In Playford's Second Book of tlze Pleascmt Musica! ,
Compam'on, Δ1687, this ballad is succeeded hythe well-
known satire upon Sir John Suckling as “a second
part ofsolm Dory made to the same tune, upon Sir
John S—— expedition into Scotland‚ 1639.'’ The
same collection contains a song on the power of
women, to the tune of the Blacksmith, beginning

 

‘⁶ Will you give me leave and l'll tell you a story,
Of what has been done by your fathers before ye,
It shall do you more good than ten of John Dory,
Which nohody can deny.’'

Barnahee's censure of those who had rather hear
“pipe than sermon,⁷' and next hidding to “dance
lively with John Dory‚'' is similar to Brathwait’s
address to the Cottoneers‚ where, after morally re-
commending the advantages of Charity, he proceeds
in the following singular manner— l

“ So time shall crowne you with an happy end, ι
And consummate the wishes of a friend ;

So each (through peace of conscience) rapt with pleasure
Shall ioifully begin to dance his measure. ι
One footing actiuely le'lson's delight‚

Descanting on this note, l lzczue done what's right,
Another ioying to be nam'd 'mongst them

VVere made men-fishers of poore fisher-men.

The third as blith as any tongue can tell,

Because he's found a faithfull Samuel.

The fourth is chanting of his notes as gladly,

Keeping the tune for th' honour of Artlzur a Βναιῖίιζγ.ἦε
The fifth so pranke, he scarce can stand on ground,
Asking who’ll sing with him Μαί Dz‘xen's round ?''

 

H* dThis ballad is printed in the Appendix to Ritson’s Robz'n
00 , 1795.
