A new English version of this apology for errata
appeared in poems by Lawrence Whyte, Dub. 1742,
12mo.—Park.

It was the fashion of that age for authors to implore
favour of the reader for the supposed discrepancies of
the press. One contemporary instance may be cited
from a volume of considerable rarity entitled: Illarslz
[τίς mickle Monument, 1645. A copy that belonged to
the author has the following lines in manuscript— ⁴

The printer was too blame, for hee hath made
My verse speak nonsence‚ in a many places :
But gentle reader let mee now perswade
Thee for to help to mend theyr halting paces :
And whatsoere I put to printing next,

Ile watch him so hee shall not mar the text.
JOHN MARSH.
